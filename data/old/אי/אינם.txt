Etymology: The word "אינם" (pronounced "ayinam") is a Hebrew word that means "they are not" or "they do not." It is derived from the Hebrew root א.נ.ה (A.N.H), which conveys negation or absence.

Grammar: "אינם" is a third-person plural masculine form of the verb "לא" (lo), which means "not." It is used to express negation or denial in the present tense. In Hebrew grammar, the verb form changes depending on the gender, number, and person of the subject.

Description: "אינם" is commonly used in modern Hebrew to negate statements about a group of people or objects. It is often used in formal or literary contexts. For example, "הם אינם יודעים" (hem einam yod'im) means "they do not know."
