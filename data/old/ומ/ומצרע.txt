Description: "וּמְצָרֵעַ" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to a person who has been afflicted with a skin disease called "tzara'at." Tzara'at is often translated as "leprosy," but it is not the same as the modern disease known as leprosy. In biblical times, tzara'at was a spiritual and physical affliction that affected not only the skin but also the person's social and religious status. The laws regarding tzara'at and its treatment are described in the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Bible.
