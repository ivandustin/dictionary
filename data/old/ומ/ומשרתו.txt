Etymology: The word "וּמְשָׁרְתוֹ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שׁרת (sh.r.t), which means "to serve" or "to minister." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the suffix ו (o) indicates the third person masculine singular possessive pronoun "his." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and his servant" or "and his minister."

In Hebrew, nouns are inflected for gender, number, and definiteness. In this case, the noun is in the masculine singular form.
