Etymology: The word "וּמַקְדֵּם" (umakdem) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק־ד־ם (q-d-m), which means "to go before" or "to precede." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the word מַקְדֵּם (makdem) is derived from the noun קֶדֶם (kedem), which means "east" or "ancient times." Therefore, the word "וּמַקְדֵּם" (umakdem) can be translated as "and eastward" or "and in ancient times."

Grammar: The word "וּמַקְדֵּם" (umakdem) is a conjunction that combines the prefix וּ (u) meaning "and" with the noun מַקְדֵּם (makdem) meaning "east" or "ancient times." It is used to connect two elements in a sentence.
