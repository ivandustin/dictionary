Etymology: The word "וּמֵאָתִים" (pronounced "u-me'atim") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וּ" (pronounced "u"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "מֵאָתִים" (pronounced "me'atim"), is a noun derived from the root אתה (pronounced "atah"), which means "to come." The prefix "מֵ" (pronounced "me") indicates "from" or "out of," and the suffix "־אִים" (pronounced "-im") is a plural ending. Therefore, "וּמֵאָתִים" can be translated as "and from hundreds" or "and out of hundreds."

Grammar: "וּמֵאָתִים" is a compound word formed by combining the conjunction "וּ" (and) with the noun "מֵאָתִים" (hundreds). In Hebrew, compound words are commonly formed by combining two or more words to create a new word with a different meaning.

Description: "וּמֵאָתִים" is used in Hebrew to indicate a quantity of "hundreds." It is often used in contexts where a specific number of hundreds is mentioned or implied. For example, if someone says "וּמֵאָתִים תלמידים" (pronounced "u-me'atim talmidim"), it means "two hundred students."
