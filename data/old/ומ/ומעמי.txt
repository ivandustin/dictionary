Etymology: The word "וּמֵעֲמִי" (pronounced "u-me'ami") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וּ" (pronounced "u"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "מֵעֲמִי" (pronounced "me'ami"), is a compound word composed of two elements: "מֵ" (pronounced "me") meaning "from" or "out of," and "עַם" (pronounced "am") meaning "people" or "nation." Therefore, the word "וּמֵעֲמִי" can be translated as "and from my people" or "and out of my nation."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "וּמֵעֲמִי" is a conjunction followed by a prepositional phrase. The conjunction "וּ" (and) connects the prepositional phrase "מֵעֲמִי" (from my people) to the rest of the sentence. The prepositional phrase "מֵעֲמִי" consists of the preposition "מֵ" (from) and the noun "עַם" (people). The word "עַם" is in the construct state, indicating possession or association.

Description: The phrase "וּמֵעֲמִי" is found in various contexts in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). It is often used to express a sense of separation or distinction. For example, it can be used to indicate that someone or something is not part of the speaker's own people or nation. It can also be used to emphasize the speaker's identity or loyalty to their own people. The phrase can be found in narratives, poetry, and prophetic texts, and its meaning may vary depending on the specific context in which it is used.
