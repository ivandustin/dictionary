Etymology: The word "וּמָעֳשִׂי" (pronounced "u-ma'osi") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עָשָׂה (asah), which means "to do" or "to make." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the suffix י (i) indicates the possessive form, so the word can be translated as "and my doing" or "and my making."

Grammar: In Hebrew, וּמָעֳשִׂי is a noun phrase composed of the conjunction וּ (u) and the noun מַעֲשֶׂה (ma'aseh), which means "work" or "deed." The possessive suffix י (i) indicates that the work or deed belongs to the speaker.

Description: וּמָעֳשִׂי is used to express ownership or possession of a specific work or deed. It can be used to refer to something that the speaker has done or made, emphasizing personal involvement or responsibility.
