Etymology: The word "וּמְתַחְתָּה" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root תחה (t-ch-h), which means "to go down" or "to descend." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the prefix מְ (me) indicates the causative form of the verb, so the word can be translated as "and causes to go down" or "and makes descend."
