Etymology: The word "וּמָעֳמוֹ" (pronounced "u-ma'omo") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עמ"ו (pronounced "a-ma") which means "to be with" or "together." The prefix וּ (pronounced "u") means "and." Therefore, "וּמָעֳמוֹ" can be translated as "and with him/her" or "and together with him/her."

Grammar: "וּמָעֳמוֹ" is a combination of the conjunction וּ (pronounced "u") meaning "and" and the preposition מֵעִם (pronounced "me'im") meaning "from" or "with." The suffix וֹ (pronounced "o") indicates the third person singular possessive form, meaning "his" or "her." Therefore, "וּמָעֳמוֹ" can be translated as "and with him" or "and from him."

Description: "וּמָעֳמוֹ" is used in Hebrew to express the idea of being together with someone or being in close proximity to someone. It can be used to indicate physical presence or a close relationship.
