Etymology: The word "וּמֵעִילִי" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע־ל־ה (ayin-lamed-hei), which means "to ascend" or "to go up." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the word מֵעִילִי (me'ilai) is derived from the noun מֵעִיל (me'il), which means "cloak" or "robe." Therefore, the word "וּמֵעִילִי" can be translated as "and my cloak" or "and my robe."

Grammar: In Hebrew, the word "וּמֵעִילִי" is composed of the conjunction וּ (u), which means "and," and the noun מֵעִילִי (me'ilai), which means "my cloak" or "my robe." The suffix י (i) indicates possession, meaning "my." The word is in the singular form.

Description: The word "וּמֵעִילִי" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Psalms (Psalm 35:2). It is part of a poetic expression used by the psalmist to describe a plea for protection and deliverance. The word signifies the psalmist's desire for God to be like a protective cloak or robe, covering and shielding him from harm.
