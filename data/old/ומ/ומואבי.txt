Etymology: The word "וֹמוֹאבִי" (pronounced "vomovi") is derived from the Hebrew root ו-מ-ב (v-m-b), which means "to desire" or "to covet." The suffix י (i) indicates the adjective form, meaning "belonging to" or "related to." Therefore, "וֹמוֹאבִי" can be translated as "Moabite" or "pertaining to Moab."

Grammar: "וֹמוֹאבִי" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. For example, if the noun is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: The term "וֹמוֹאבִי" refers to something or someone that is associated with the ancient kingdom of Moab. The Moabites were a people who inhabited the region east of the Jordan River, in what is now modern-day Jordan. In the Bible, the Moabites are often mentioned as neighbors and sometimes enemies of the Israelites. The term can also be used to describe the Moabite language, culture, or historical artifacts.
