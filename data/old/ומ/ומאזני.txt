Description: "וּמְאַזְנַיִם" is a Hebrew word that refers to the body part known as "ears". Ears are sensory organs responsible for hearing and maintaining balance. They are located on the sides of the head and consist of the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear.

Ears play a crucial role in communication and are essential for our ability to hear and perceive sound.
