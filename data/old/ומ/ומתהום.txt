Etymology: The word "וּמְתַהְוֵה" is a Hebrew word derived from the root מ.ה.ו (M.H.W), which means "to wait" or "to hope". The prefix וּ (u) means "and", and the verb form הִתְפַּעֵל (hitpa'el) indicates reflexive action, so the word can be translated as "and he/she waits" or "and he/she hopes".

Grammar: "וּמְתַהְוֵה" is a verb form in the present tense, third person singular. It is conjugated in the hitpa'el verb form, which is used for reflexive actions or actions done to oneself. The prefix וּ (u) indicates the conjunction "and", and the root מ.ה.ו (M.H.W) is the base of the verb.

Description: "וּמְתַהְוֵה" describes the action of waiting or hoping. It implies a state of anticipation or expectation. The reflexive form suggests that the subject is waiting or hoping for something for themselves.
