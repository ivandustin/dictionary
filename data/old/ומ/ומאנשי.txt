Etymology: The word "וְמָאֹנְשִׁי" is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root letters מ-א-נ-ש, which means "to count" or "to number." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the suffix י (yod) indicates the possessive form, so the word can be translated as "and my number" or "and my count."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "וְמָאֹנְשִׁי" is a compound word made up of the conjunction וְ (vav) and the noun מָאֹנְשִׁי (ma'onshi). The noun is in the singular form and is modified by the possessive suffix י (yod), which indicates the first person possessive ("my").

Description: "וְמָאֹנְשִׁי" is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Psalm 39:5) and is translated as "and my number" or "and my count." It is used metaphorically to express the fleeting nature of human life and the insignificance of individual existence in the grand scheme of things. The phrase emphasizes the transient nature of human life and the need for humility and perspective.
