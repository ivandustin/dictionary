Etymology: The word "וַמְבֻמוֹת" (vam'bumot) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב.מ.ה (b.m.h), which means "to build" or "to construct."

Grammar: "וַמְבֻמוֹת" is a noun in the plural form. It is derived from the verb "בָּנָה" (bana), which means "to build." The prefix "וַ" (va) indicates the conjunction "and," and the suffix "-ות" (-ot) indicates the plural form.

Description: "וַמְבֻמוֹת" refers to "high places" or "elevated platforms" that were used for religious worship in ancient times. These platforms were often built on hills or mountains and were associated with the worship of idols or false gods. In the Hebrew Bible, the term is often used in a negative context, as the worship at these high places was considered idolatrous and contrary to the worship of the one true God.
