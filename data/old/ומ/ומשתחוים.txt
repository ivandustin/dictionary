Etymology: The word "וַמְשֵׁתְחוּיִם" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שׁ.ח.ה (sh.ch.h), which means "to bow down" or "to prostrate oneself." The prefix וַ (va) means "and," and the suffix יִם (im) indicates plural masculine. Therefore, the word can be translated as "and they bowed down" or "and they prostrated themselves."

Grammar: "וַמְשֵׁתְחוּיִם" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the third person plural masculine, indicating that the subject of the verb is a group of males. The verb is conjugated in the binyan (verb form) called "piel," which often denotes an intensive or causative action. In this case, it intensifies the action of bowing down or prostrating oneself.
