Etymology: The word "וּמַחְץ" (umachatz) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root חץ (chetz), which means "to divide" or "to split." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," so the word literally means "and split."

Grammar: "וּמַחְץ" is a noun in the masculine gender. It is in the singular form, but it can also be used in the plural form as "וּמַחְצָיִם" (umachatzayim).

Description: "וּמַחְץ" is a term used in the Passover Seder, specifically during the ritual of breaking the middle matzah. It refers to the piece of matzah that is broken in half, with one half being set aside as the afikomen and the other half being returned to the matzah plate. The breaking of the matzah symbolizes the division between slavery and freedom, and the afikomen represents the dessert that is eaten at the end of the meal.
