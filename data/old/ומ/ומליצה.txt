Etymology: The word "וּמְלִיצָה" (umlitzah) is a Hebrew noun derived from the root word "לצה" (litzah), which means "to mock" or "to ridicule." The prefix "וּ" (u) indicates the conjunction "and," and the prefix "מְ" (me) denotes the passive voice. Therefore, "וּמְלִיצָה" can be translated as "mockery" or "ridicule."

The feminine form is used when referring to a female noun or when the noun itself is inherently feminine. The singular form indicates that there is only one instance of the noun.
