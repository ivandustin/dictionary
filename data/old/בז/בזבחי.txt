Description: "בזבחי" is a term used in Jewish religious practices to describe the various types of sacrifices or offerings that were made in the ancient Temple in Jerusalem. These sacrifices were an integral part of the religious rituals and were offered to God as a form of worship and atonement for sins. The types of sacrifices included burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. Each type of sacrifice had specific rules and procedures that needed to be followed. The sacrifices were performed by the priests and were accompanied by prayers and rituals. Today, since the destruction of the Temple, the practice of offering sacrifices has ceased, but the term "בזבחי" is still used in religious texts and discussions to refer to these ancient rituals.
