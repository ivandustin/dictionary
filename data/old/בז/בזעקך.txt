Etymology: The word "בזעקך" comes from the Hebrew language. It is a combination of the preposition "ב" (meaning "in" or "with") and the noun "זעק" (meaning "cry" or "shout").

Grammar: "בזעקך" is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts. The preposition "ב" is used to indicate a state or condition, and it is followed by the noun "זעק" in its possessive form, which means "your cry" or "your shout". The suffix "ך" indicates that the cry or shout belongs to the second person singular, addressing one person.
