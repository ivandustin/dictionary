Etymology: The word "קברינו" comes from the Hebrew language. It is a combination of the root word "קבר" (kaver), meaning "to bury," and the suffix "-ינו" (-inu), which indicates possession or belonging. Therefore, "קברינו" can be translated as "our burial" or "our grave."

Grammar: "קברינו" is a noun in Hebrew, specifically a possessive noun. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ינו" to the root word "קבר." The suffix "-ינו" indicates possession or belonging to the first person plural (we/our).

Description: "קברינו" refers to a burial or grave that belongs to "us" or "we." It is used to express ownership or possession of a burial site by a group of people.
