Etymology: The word "הַדְדָעֶזֶר" (HaDada'ezer) is a Hebrew word. It is composed of two parts: "הַדְדָע" (HaDada) and "עֶזֶר" (ezer). "הַדְדָע" (HaDada) means "the knowledge" or "the science," and "עֶזֶר" (ezer) means "help" or "assistance." Therefore, the word can be translated as "the knowledge of help" or "the science of assistance."

Grammar: "הַדְדָעֶזֶר" (HaDada'ezer) is a noun in Hebrew. It is a compound word formed by combining two nouns, "הַדְדָע" (HaDada) and "עֶזֶר" (ezer), with the definite article "הַ" (Ha) at the beginning. In Hebrew, the definite article is used to indicate specificity or uniqueness.

Description: "הַדְדָעֶזֶר" (HaDada'ezer) is not a commonly used word in modern Hebrew. It appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in 2 Samuel 8:9 and 1 Chronicles 18:8, where it is used as a proper name for a king of Zobah. The meaning of the word in this context is not entirely clear, and it is often interpreted as a combination of two names or as a title for the king.
