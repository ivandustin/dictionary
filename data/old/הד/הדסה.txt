Description: The myrtle tree, or "הדסה," is a small evergreen tree or shrub with fragrant white flowers and dark green leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is cultivated in many parts of the world for its ornamental value. In Jewish tradition, the myrtle branch is one of the four species used in the religious rituals of Sukkot, along with the palm branch, willow branch, and citron fruit. The myrtle branch is held together with the other three species and waved during certain prayers and blessings.
