Etymology: The word "ירבעם" (Yerav'am) is a Hebrew name that is derived from two elements. The first part, "יר" (yer), is a shortened form of the divine name "יהוה" (Yahweh). The second part, "בעם" (av'am), means "of the people" or "with the people." Therefore, the name Yerav'am can be translated as "Yahweh has increased the people" or "Yahweh's people have increased."

Grammar: "ירבעם" (Yerav'am) is a proper noun in Hebrew. It is a masculine name that is used to refer to a biblical figure, specifically the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the split of the united monarchy.

Description: Yerav'am was a significant figure in biblical history. He reigned over the northern kingdom of Israel for 22 years, from approximately 930 to 909 BCE. Yerav'am is known for his idolatrous practices and for leading the people of Israel away from the worship of Yahweh. His reign marked a period of religious and political division in Israel, which ultimately led to the downfall of the northern kingdom.
