Etymology: The word "ירחמאל" (Yerachmael) is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. "ירח" (yerach) means "moon" and "מאל" (mael) is a variant of the Hebrew word "אל" (el) which means "God". Therefore, the name Yerachmael can be translated as "God's moon" or "moon of God".

Grammar: In Hebrew, "ירחמאל" (Yerachmael) is a masculine proper noun. It consists of three syllables: "ye-rach-ma-el". The first syllable "ye" is a prefix that indicates the third person possessive form. The second syllable "rach" means "moon" and the third syllable "mael" means "God".

Description: Yerachmael is a name that is not commonly used in modern times. It has biblical origins and can be found in the Hebrew Bible. The name carries a sense of connection to the moon and to God, suggesting a celestial and divine association.
