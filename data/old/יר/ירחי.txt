Etymology: The word "ירחי" (pronounced "yirchi") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root רחה (rachah), which means "to have mercy" or "to show compassion." The word ירחי is derived from the noun רחמים (rachamim), which means "mercy" or "compassion."

Grammar: ירחי is an adjective in the masculine plural form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine, singular, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: ירחי is used to describe someone or something that is merciful or compassionate. It is often used to refer to God's mercy or compassion towards humanity.
