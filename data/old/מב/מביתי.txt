Etymology: The word "מביתי" (meviti) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בית (bayit), which means "house" or "home". The prefix מ (me) indicates possession or belonging, so "מביתי" can be translated as "from my house" or "belonging to my house".

Grammar: "מביתי" is a possessive adjective in Hebrew. It is used to indicate ownership or belonging. In this case, it specifically refers to something that belongs to the speaker's house.

Description: "מביתי" is used to describe something that is from or belongs to the speaker's house. It can be used to indicate possession of an object or to describe the origin of something. For example, if someone says "זה הספר מביתי" (ze ha-sefer meviti), it means "this book is from my house" or "this book belongs to my house".
