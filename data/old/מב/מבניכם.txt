Etymology: The word "מבניקם" (pronounced "mavnikim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בנק (bnq), which means "to suckle" or "to nurse." It is derived from the noun בן (ben), meaning "son" or "child," and the verb נקה (naka), meaning "to nurse" or "to suckle."

Grammar: "מבניקם" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ם (im) to the root word בניק (bennik), which means "nursing" or "suckling." The prefix מ (m) indicates possession, so the word can be translated as "their nurslings" or "their sucklings."

Description: "מבניקם" refers to the young children or infants who are being nursed or breastfed. It is used to describe the act of nursing or breastfeeding, as well as the children who are being nursed.
