Etymology: The word "מבלתי" (mivla'ti) is derived from the Hebrew root ב-ל-ת (B-L-T), which means "without" or "lacking". It is a negation prefix that is added to verbs to indicate the absence or negation of the action.

Grammar: "מבלתי" is a preposition in Hebrew that is used to express negation or absence. It is often followed by a verb in the infinitive form. It is similar in meaning to the English word "without" or the prefix "un-" in some cases.
