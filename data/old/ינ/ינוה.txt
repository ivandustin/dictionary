Etymology: The word "ינוה" (Yonah) comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root word "ינה" (Y.N.H), which means "to oppress" or "to afflict."

Grammar: "ינוה" is a noun in Hebrew and is commonly used as a proper name. It is typically used to refer to the biblical figure Jonah, who is known for being swallowed by a large fish.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, Jonah is a prophet who is sent by God to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh, a city known for its wickedness. However, Jonah initially tries to flee from his mission and ends up being swallowed by a large fish. After three days and nights in the fish's belly, Jonah is vomited out onto dry land and finally fulfills his mission by delivering God's message to the people of Nineveh. The story of Jonah is often seen as a lesson in obedience and repentance.
