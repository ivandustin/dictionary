Etymology: The word "למטעמתיו" is a Hebrew phrase composed of several words. "ל" (pronounced "l") means "to" or "for" in English. "מטעמת" (pronounced "mita'amot") is the plural form of the word "מטעם" (pronounced "mita'am"), which means "reason" or "cause". "יו" (pronounced "yo") is a suffix that indicates possession or belonging. Therefore, "למטעמתיו" can be translated as "for his/her/its reasons" or "for the sake of his/her/its reasons".

Grammar: "למטעמתיו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (pronounced "l") is followed by the noun "מטעמתיו" (pronounced "mita'amotav"), which is a possessive form of the noun "מטעם" (pronounced "mita'am"). The possessive form is created by adding the suffix "יו" (pronounced "yo") to the noun. In this case, the possessive form indicates that the reasons belong to a third person singular masculine.

Description: "למטעמתיו" is used to express that something is done or happening for a specific reason or cause. It implies that the reason or cause is known or understood by the speaker or writer, but it may not be explicitly stated. The phrase is often used to explain or justify an action or decision.
