The prefix "ל" (pronounced "le") in Hebrew often indicates "to" or "for," so "למישר" can be translated as "to straighten" or "for straightening."

It is often used in Hebrew to express the idea of an action or state without specifying who is performing the action or when it is happening. In this case, "למישר" can be translated as "to straighten" or "to make straight."
