Etymology: The word "למקרה" (lemikreh) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "ל" (l) which means "to" or "for" and "מקרה" (mikreh) which means "incident" or "event". Therefore, "למקרה" can be translated as "for an incident" or "in case of an event".

Grammar: "למקרה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (l) is used to indicate direction or purpose, and "מקרה" (mikreh) is a noun meaning "incident" or "event". Together, they form a phrase that indicates the purpose or direction of an action.

Description: "למקרה" is commonly used in Hebrew to express the idea of doing something in preparation for a possible future event or incident. It is often used in phrases such as "למקרה ש" (lemikreh she), which means "in case that" or "if". For example, "אני אגיד לו למקרה שיש שינויים" (Ani agid lo le'mikreh sheyesh shinuyim) translates to "I will tell him in case there are any changes".
