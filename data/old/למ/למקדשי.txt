Etymology: The word "למקדשי" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "קדש" (kadesh), which means "holy" or "sanctified". The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew indicates "to" or "for", so "למקדשי" can be translated as "for my holy places" or "to my sanctuaries".

Grammar: "למקדשי" is a possessive form in Hebrew, indicating ownership or belonging. The prefix "ל" (lamed) indicates possession, and the suffix "-י" (yod) indicates the first person singular possessive form. Therefore, "למקדשי" can be translated as "my holy places" or "my sanctuaries".

Description: "למקדשי" is a phrase commonly used in religious contexts in Hebrew, referring to places that are considered holy or sanctified. It can refer to specific locations such as temples, synagogues, or other sacred sites. The phrase emphasizes the connection between the speaker and these holy places, indicating a sense of ownership or personal attachment.
