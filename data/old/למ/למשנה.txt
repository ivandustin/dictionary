Grammar: "למשנה" is a noun in Hebrew, specifically a feminine noun. It is often used to refer to the Mishnah, which is a collection of Jewish oral traditions and teachings that were compiled and written down in the early centuries of the Common Era.

Description: The Mishnah is one of the central texts of Jewish law and serves as the foundation for the Talmud, which is a commentary and analysis of the Mishnah.
