Description: "חלצים" is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a specific ritual that is performed in the case of a childless widow whose husband died without leaving any children. According to Jewish law, the brother of the deceased husband has an obligation to marry the widow and have children with her in order to continue the family line. However, if the brother does not wish to marry the widow, he can perform the ritual of חליצה (chalitzah), which involves removing his shoe and spitting in front of the widow.

The plural form חלצים is used to refer to the brothers who perform this ritual.
