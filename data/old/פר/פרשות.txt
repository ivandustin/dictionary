Etymology: The word "פרשות" (pronounced "parashot") is derived from the Hebrew root פ-ר-ש, which means "to separate" or "to divide." It is related to the noun פרשה (parashah), which means "portion" or "section."

Grammar: פרשות is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is the plural form of פרשה (parashah), which is a feminine noun. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The plural form is used to refer to multiple portions or sections.

Description: פרשות is commonly used to refer to the weekly Torah portions in Judaism. The Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, is divided into 54 portions, each of which is read and studied on a specific week of the year. These portions are called פרשות. Each פרשה focuses on a specific theme or narrative and is read in synagogue services on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) and during other Jewish holidays.

The פרשות are an important part of Jewish religious practice and study. They provide a structured way to read and study the entire Torah over the course of a year. The פרשות are often accompanied by commentaries and interpretations from Jewish scholars and rabbis, which further enrich the understanding and application of the Torah's teachings.
