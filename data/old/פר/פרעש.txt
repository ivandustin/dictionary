Etymology: The word "פרעש" (pronounced "par'ash" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root פ-ר-ע-ש (P-R-A-SH), which means "to explain" or "to interpret."

Grammar: In Hebrew, פרעש is a noun that is commonly used to refer to a commentary or explanation of a biblical text. It is often used to describe the traditional commentaries written by Jewish scholars, known as "parashot" or "parshanim," which provide interpretations and insights into the meaning of the Torah.

Description: פרעש is an important aspect of Jewish study and scholarship. It involves analyzing and interpreting the biblical text, exploring its historical context, linguistic nuances, and moral teachings. The goal of פרעש is to gain a deeper understanding of the text and its relevance to contemporary life. It is often studied in conjunction with the weekly Torah portion, with scholars and students delving into the parashah (portion) and its associated commentaries.
