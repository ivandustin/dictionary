Etymology: The word "צדקיהו" (pronounced "Tzidkiyahu" in English) is a Hebrew name that is derived from the Hebrew words "צדק" (meaning "justice" or "righteousness") and "יהו" (a shortened form of the name of God, "יהוה" or "Yahweh"). Therefore, "צדקיהו" can be translated as "God is my righteousness" or "God is just."

Grammar: "צדקיהו" is a masculine Hebrew name. It is formed by combining the root word "צדק" with the suffix "-יהו" which indicates possession or belonging. In Hebrew, names often have significant meanings and reflect the character or attributes of the person.
