Etymology: The word "לחצרותיו" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "חצר" (chatser), which means "courtyard" or "enclosure". The suffix "-ו" (vav) indicates possession, so "לחצרותיו" can be translated as "to his courtyards" or "to his enclosures".

Grammar: "לחצרותיו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (lamed) means "to" or "for", and it is followed by the noun "חצרותיו" (chatserotav), which means "his courtyards" or "his enclosures". The suffix "-יו" (av) indicates possession, so it refers to someone's own courtyards or enclosures.
