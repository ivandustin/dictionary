Etymology: The word "כראים" (pronounced "karaim") is derived from the Hebrew word "כראי" which means "readers" or "scripture readers". It refers to a Jewish religious movement that emerged in the 8th century in the Byzantine Empire.

Grammar: "כראים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to the followers or practitioners of the Karaite movement.

Description: The Karaites are a Jewish sect that rejects the authority of the Talmud and other rabbinic writings, and instead relies solely on the Hebrew Bible as the source of religious law. They emphasize a literal interpretation of the Bible and reject the oral tradition and interpretations of the rabbis. The Karaites have their own unique religious practices and customs, and they have historically been a small minority within the Jewish community.
