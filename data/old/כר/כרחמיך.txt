Etymology: The word "כרחמיך" (pronounced "karachmicha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root רחם (racham), which means "mercy" or "compassion". The prefix כ (k) is a preposition that means "like" or "as". Therefore, כרחמיך can be translated as "like your mercy" or "as your mercy".

Grammar: כרחמיך is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word כ (k) is a preposition, and רחמיך (rachamicha) is the possessive form of the noun רחמים (rachamim), which means "mercy" or "compassion". The suffix ך (cha) indicates the second person singular possessive form, meaning "your".

Description: כרחמיך is a phrase used in Hebrew to express a request or desire for something to be done with the same level of mercy or compassion as the person being addressed. It is often used in prayers or supplications, asking for God's mercy or compassion to be extended to the person making the request.
