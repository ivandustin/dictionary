Etymology: The word "יתאבל" (pronounced "yit'abel") is a Hebrew verb derived from the root אבל (pronounced "avel"), which means "to mourn" or "to grieve." The prefix י (pronounced "y") indicates the future tense, so יתאבל means "he will mourn" or "he will grieve."

Grammar: יתאבל is a verb in the future tense, third person masculine singular form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject, tense, and gender of the sentence. The prefix י indicates the future tense, and the suffix בל (pronounced "bel") indicates the third person masculine singular form.
