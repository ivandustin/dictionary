Etymology: The word "לאבתם" (pronounced "le'avtam") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "אב" (pronounced "av"), which means "father." The prefix "ל" (pronounced "le") indicates possession or belonging. Therefore, "לאבתם" can be translated as "their father's" or "belonging to their father."

Grammar: "לאבתם" is a possessive noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the prefix "ל" (meaning "to" or "belonging to") to the word "אב" (meaning "father"), and then adding the plural possessive suffix "-תם" (pronounced "tam") to indicate possession by a group of people.

Description: "לאבתם" is used to describe something that belongs to or is associated with a group of people's father. It can refer to possessions, characteristics, or relationships that are connected to their father.
