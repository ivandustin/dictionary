Grammar: "לאבותיהם" is a plural possessive form in Hebrew. The prefix "ל" (le) indicates direction or possession, and the root word "אבות" (avot) means "fathers." The suffix "יהם" (eyhem) indicates possession by a plural subject, meaning "their."

Description: "לאבותיהם" is used in Hebrew to refer to something that belongs to or is related to a group of fathers. It can be used in various contexts, such as describing an inheritance or a tradition passed down from fathers to their descendants.
