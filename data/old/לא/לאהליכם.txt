Etymology: The word "לאהליכם" is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "אהל" (ohel), which means "tent" or "dwelling place". The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew often indicates "to" or "for", so "לאהליכם" can be translated as "to your tents" or "for your dwellings".

Grammar: "לאהליכם" is a plural form of the word, indicating that it is addressing a group of people. The word is composed of the preposition "ל" (lamed) followed by the noun "אהלים" (ohalim), which means "tents" or "dwellings". The suffix "יכם" (eichem) is a possessive pronoun meaning "your".

Description: "לאהליכם" is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in the book of Deuteronomy. It is used as a call to action, urging the Israelites to return to their tents or dwellings. It can be interpreted as a command to disperse or retreat, often used in the context of ending a gathering or assembly.
