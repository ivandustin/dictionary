Etymology: The word "לאסתר" (pronounced "le'ester") is a Hebrew word that comes from the Aramaic language. It is derived from the root word "אסתר" (pronounced "ester"), which means "hidden" or "concealed."

Grammar: "לאסתר" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word "ל" (pronounced "le") is a preposition that means "to" or "for," and "אסתר" is the noun form of the root word mentioned earlier. Together, "לאסתר" means "to Esther" or "for Esther."

Description: In Jewish tradition, the word "לאסתר" is used to refer to the Book of Esther, which is one of the books in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). The Book of Esther tells the story of Queen Esther, who played a crucial role in saving the Jewish people from a plot to annihilate them. The phrase "לאסתר" is often used to describe events or actions that are done in a hidden or concealed manner, similar to how Queen Esther's identity as a Jew was initially hidden.
