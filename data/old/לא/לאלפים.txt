Etymology: The word "לאלפים" (L'alfim) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ל.א.ל.ף (L.A.L.P), which means "to thousands" or "to many." It is derived from the Hebrew word אלף (elef), which means "thousand."

Grammar: "לאלפים" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word ל (L) is a preposition that means "to" or "for," and אלפים (alfim) is the plural form of the word אלף (elef), which means "thousand." Together, they form the phrase "to thousands" or "for thousands."

Description: The phrase "לאלפים" is often used in Hebrew to indicate a large number or quantity.
