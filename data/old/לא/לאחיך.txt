Etymology: The word "לאחיך" (pronounced "le'acheicha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root א.ח.כ (A.Ch.Kh), which means "to your brother." It is derived from the Hebrew word "אח" (ach), meaning "brother," and the possessive pronoun "ל" (le), meaning "to" or "for."

Grammar: "לאחיך" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word "ל" (le) is a preposition that indicates direction or possession, and "אחיך" (acheicha) is the plural form of the word "אח" (ach), meaning "brother." Therefore, "לאחיך" translates to "to your brothers" or "for your brothers."

Description: "לאחיך" is used in Hebrew to refer to multiple brothers. It can be used to address or indicate possession towards a group of brothers.
