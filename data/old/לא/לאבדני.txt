Etymology: The word "לאבדני" (pronounced "le'abedni") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "אבד" (pronounced "avad"), which means "to lose" or "to perish". The suffix "ני" (pronounced "ni") is a possessive pronoun that means "my" or "mine". Therefore, "לאבדני" can be translated as "my loss" or "my perishing".

Grammar: "לאבדני" is a first-person possessive form of the noun "אבדה" (pronounced "avdah"), which means "loss" or "perishing". The prefix "ל" (pronounced "le") indicates the preposition "to" or "for". The suffix "ני" (pronounced "ni") indicates possession by the first-person singular pronoun "I" or "me". Therefore, "לאבדני" can be translated as "to my loss" or "for my perishing".

Description: "לאבדני" is a Hebrew word that expresses a personal sense of loss or perishing. It can be used to describe a feeling of being lost, overwhelmed, or in a state of despair. It can also be used metaphorically to express a sense of being emotionally or spiritually lost.
