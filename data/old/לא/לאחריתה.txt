Etymology: The word "לאחריתה" (le'acharitah) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "ל" (le), which means "to" or "towards," and "אחריתה" (acharitah), which means "her end" or "her outcome." 

Grammar: "לאחריתה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (le) indicates direction or purpose, and it is followed by the noun "אחריתה" (acharitah), which is the feminine form of the noun "אחרית" (acharit), meaning "end" or "outcome." The suffix "ה" (ah) indicates possession, so "אחריתה" means "her end" or "her outcome."

Description: "לאחריתה" is used to describe something that is done or intended for the purpose of achieving a certain outcome or result. It implies a sense of direction or goal-oriented action.
