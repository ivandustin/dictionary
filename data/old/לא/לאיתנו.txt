Etymology: The word "לאיתנו" (pronounced "le'etno") is a Hebrew word that means "to us" or "for us". It is derived from the Hebrew preposition "ל" (pronounced "le") meaning "to" or "for", and the Hebrew pronoun "איתנו" (pronounced "etno") meaning "us" or "we".

Grammar: "לאיתנו" is a combination of the preposition "ל" (pronounced "le") and the pronoun "איתנו" (pronounced "etno"). In Hebrew, the preposition "ל" is used to indicate direction or purpose, while the pronoun "איתנו" is the first person plural form of the pronoun "אני" (pronounced "ani") meaning "I" or "me". When combined, "לאיתנו" indicates that something is directed towards or intended for the speaker and others.

Description: The word "לאיתנו" is commonly used in Hebrew to express possession or ownership. It is often used to indicate that something belongs to or is intended for a specific group of people, including the speaker. For example, "הספר שלאיתנו" (pronounced "ha'sefer she'le'etno") means "the book that belongs to us" or "our book".
