Etymology: The word "כפסח" (kaf-sach) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כפסח, which means "to pass over" or "to skip." It is derived from the biblical story of the Passover, where the Israelites were instructed to mark their doorposts with the blood of a lamb so that the angel of death would "pass over" their homes.

Grammar: "כפסח" is a noun in Hebrew and is typically used to refer to the Passover holiday or the Passover lamb sacrifice. It can also be used as a verb to describe the act of observing or celebrating Passover.

Description: Passover, or פסח (Pesach) in Hebrew, is a major Jewish holiday that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. It is celebrated for seven or eight days in the spring, beginning on the 15th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan. During Passover, Jews refrain from eating leavened bread (chametz) and instead eat unleavened bread (matzah) to symbolize the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt. The Passover Seder, a festive meal and ritual, is held on the first two nights of the holiday and includes the retelling of the Exodus story, the consumption of symbolic foods, and the recitation of prayers and blessings. The Passover lamb sacrifice, which was traditionally offered in the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, is no longer practiced today.
