Grammar: In Hebrew, כפלח is a noun that is derived from the root כפל (kaf-lamed). It is in the singular form and is masculine.

Description: כפלח is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a type of monetary penalty. It is a form of compensation that is double the value of the damage caused. This concept is derived from the biblical verse in Exodus 22:3, which states, "If the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him; he shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft." The Talmudic sages interpreted this verse to mean that if a thief is caught during the day, he must pay double the value of what he stole. This concept of כפלח is still relevant in Jewish legal discussions today.
