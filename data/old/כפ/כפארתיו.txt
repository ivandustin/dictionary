Etymology: The word "כְּפָאֵרְתִיו" comes from the Hebrew root כּ.פ.ר (k.p.r), which means "to cover" or "to atone." It is derived from the noun כַּפֹּרֶת (kapporet), which refers to the cover of the Ark of the Covenant in the Hebrew Bible.

Grammar: כְּפָאֵרְתִיו is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: כְּפָאֵר (k'fa'er), which means "to cover," תִּיו (tiyv), which is a suffix indicating "his," and the prefix כְּ (k'), which means "like" or "as." Together, the word means "his cover" or "his atonement."

Description: כְּפָאֵרְתִיו is a term used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the cover of the Ark of the Covenant. It is described as a solid gold cover with two cherubim (angelic figures) facing each other, with their wings spread out and overshadowing the cover. The cover was considered a sacred and holy object, and it was believed to be the place where God's presence would manifest itself. It was also associated with the atonement of sins and the forgiveness of the Israelites.
