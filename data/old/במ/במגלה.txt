Etymology: The word "במגלה" (pronounced "b'magelah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root letters ב-מ-ג-ל, which means "to reveal" or "to uncover". It is derived from the noun "מגלה" (pronounced "megillah"), which means "scroll" or "parchment".

Grammar: "במגלה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew, consisting of the preposition "ב" (pronounced "b") meaning "in" or "with", and the noun "מגלה" (pronounced "megillah") meaning "scroll" or "parchment". It is used to indicate that something is written or contained within a scroll or parchment.
