Grammar: "במליצי" is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts. The preposition "ב" is used to indicate location or possession, and it is followed by the noun "מליץ" in its construct form. The construct form is used to show a relationship between two nouns, where the second noun modifies or completes the meaning of the first noun.
