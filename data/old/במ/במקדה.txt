Etymology: The word "בְּמַקְדֵּשׁ" (bemikdash) comes from the Hebrew root ק־ד־שׁ (q-d-sh), which means "to sanctify" or "to set apart." It is derived from the noun מִקְדָּשׁ (mikdash), meaning "sanctuary" or "holy place."

Grammar: "בְּמַקְדֵּשׁ" (bemikdash) is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition בְּ (be) means "in" or "at," and the noun מַקְדֵּשׁ (mikdash) means "sanctuary" or "holy place." Together, they form the phrase "in the sanctuary" or "at the holy place."

Description: "בְּמַקְדֵּשׁ" (bemikdash) refers to the holy sanctuary in Judaism, specifically the Temple in Jerusalem. It was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Jewish people in ancient times. The Temple was destroyed twice, first by the Babylonians in 586 BCE and then by the Romans in 70 CE. Today, the Western Wall (also known as the Wailing Wall) is the only remaining part of the Temple complex and is considered a holy site for Jewish prayer and reflection.
