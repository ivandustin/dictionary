Etymology: The word "במצותיו" (betzuto) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "ב" (bet) means "in" or "with," and "מצותיו" (mitzvotav) means "his commandments" or "his precepts." Therefore, "במצותיו" can be translated as "in his commandments" or "with his precepts."

Grammar: "במצותיו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (bet) indicates a location or a state of being "in" or "with." The noun "מצותיו" (mitzvotav) is a plural form of the word "מצוה" (mitzvah), which means "commandment" or "precept." The suffix "-יו" (-av) indicates possession, so "מצותיו" means "his commandments" or "his precepts."
