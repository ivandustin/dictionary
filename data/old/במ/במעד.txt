Etymology: The word "במעד" (pronounced "bama'ad" in Hebrew) is derived from the root עד (pronounced "ad"), which means "until" or "up to." The prefix ב (pronounced "be") indicates "in" or "at." Therefore, "במעד" can be translated as "in the time of" or "at the time of."

Grammar: "במעד" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition ב indicates location or time, and the noun מעד means "time" or "occasion." Together, they form the phrase "במעד," which is used to describe a specific time or event.
