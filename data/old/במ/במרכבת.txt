Etymology: The word "במרקבת" (bemerkavet) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root רקב (r.q.b), which means "to rot" or "to decay". The prefix ב (be) means "in" or "at", so במרקבת literally means "in decay" or "in a state of decomposition".

Grammar: במרקבת is a noun in the singular feminine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, and they can be modified by definite or indefinite articles. The word במרקבת is modified by the definite article ה (ha), which makes it "הבמרקבת" (habemerkavet) when used in a specific context.
