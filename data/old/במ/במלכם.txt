Etymology: The word "במלכם" (pronounced "bemalkham") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "ב" (pronounced "be"), is a preposition meaning "in" or "at." The second part, "מלכם" (pronounced "malkham"), is a noun derived from the root "מלך" (pronounced "melekh"), which means "king." Therefore, "במלכם" can be translated as "in/at their kingdom" or "in/at their reign."

Grammar: "במלכם" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" indicates location or possession, and the noun "מלכם" functions as the object of the preposition. In this case, "מלכם" is in the plural form, indicating that it refers to multiple kings or a collective reign.

Description: "במלכם" is used in Hebrew to describe a location or situation where multiple kings are present or where a collective reign exists. It can be used in historical or metaphorical contexts to refer to a period of time when multiple rulers or authorities are in power.
