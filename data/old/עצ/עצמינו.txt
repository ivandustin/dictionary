Etymology: The word "עצמינו" (pronounced "atzmunu" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root עצם (atzam), which means "bone" or "essence." The suffix ינו (inu) is a possessive pronoun that means "our" or "ourselves." Therefore, עצמינו translates to "ourselves" or "our own."

Grammar: עצמינו is a plural form of the word עצמי (atzmi), which means "myself" or "my own." It is used to refer to a group of people, indicating possession or ownership. In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are formed by adding the suffix ינו (inu) to the root word.
