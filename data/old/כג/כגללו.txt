Etymology: The word "כגללו" (pronounced "kaglalo") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root גלל (galal), which means "to roll" or "to turn." The prefix כ (k) means "like" or "as," so כגללו can be translated as "like its rolling" or "as it turns."

Grammar: כגללו is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The prefix כ (k) functions as a preposition meaning "like" or "as," and גללו is the third person singular possessive form of the noun גלגל (galgal), which means "wheel" or "rolling." Together, כגללו means "like its rolling" or "as it turns."

Description: כגללו is used to describe something that is similar to or resembles the rolling or turning of a wheel. It can be used metaphorically to describe the movement or behavior of a person or object.
