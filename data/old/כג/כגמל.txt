Description: The camel is a large mammal with a humped back, long legs, and a long neck. It is known for its ability to survive in arid and desert environments. Camels are commonly found in the Middle East and North Africa and have been used for transportation and as pack animals for centuries. They are well-adapted to desert life, with features such as a thick coat to protect against the sun and the ability to store water in their humps. Camels are also known for their ability to go long periods without water and their endurance in harsh conditions.
