Etymology: The word "מִירְכֶּתִי" (mirkheti) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root רָכַת (rakhat), which means "to soften" or "to make tender." The prefix מִי־ (mi-) indicates the passive form, so מִירְכֶּתִי (mirkheti) can be translated as "made tender" or "softened."

Grammar: מִירְכֶּתִי (mirkheti) is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: מִירְכֶּתִי (mirkheti) describes something that has been made tender or softened. It can be used to describe physical objects, such as food that has been cooked until it is soft and tender. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a person's character or attitude, indicating that they are gentle, kind, or compassionate.
