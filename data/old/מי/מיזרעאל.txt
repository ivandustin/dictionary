Etymology: The word "מיזרעאל" (Mizra'el) is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. "מזרע" (mizra) means "seed" or "offspring," and "אל" (el) is a shortened form of "אלוהים" (elohim), which means "God" in Hebrew. Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "seed of God" or "offspring of God."

Grammar: "מיזרעאל" (Mizra'el) is a noun in Hebrew. It is a compound word formed by combining the two elements mentioned above. In Hebrew, nouns can have gender and number, but "מיזרעאל" (Mizra'el) does not change in form for gender or number.

Description: "מיזרעאל" (Mizra'el) is a name that is not commonly used in modern Hebrew. It has biblical origins and is associated with the angelic realm. In Jewish tradition, Mizra'el is considered one of the archangels, often associated with the element of earth and the protection of the dead.
