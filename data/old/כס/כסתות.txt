Etymology: The word "כְּסֹתָה" (k'sotah) is derived from the Hebrew root כסה (k-s-h), which means "to cover" or "to conceal."

Grammar: כְּסֹתָה is a noun in the feminine singular form. It is used to refer to a specific type of ritual in ancient Hebrew culture.

Description: In ancient Hebrew culture, a כְּסֹתָה (k'sotah) was a woman suspected of adultery. The ritual of the כְּסֹתָה was performed to determine her guilt or innocence. The ritual involved the woman drinking a special concoction made from water and dust from the Tabernacle floor. If she was guilty, it was believed that the water would cause her belly to swell and her thigh to rot. If she was innocent, she would remain unharmed. The כְּסֹתָה ritual is described in the Book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible.
