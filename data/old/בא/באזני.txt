Etymology: The word "באזני" (pronounced "bazni") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-א-ז, which means "to hear" or "to listen". The suffix ני (-ni) is a possessive suffix that means "my" or "of mine". Therefore, "באזני" can be translated as "in my ears" or "of mine ears".

Grammar: "באזני" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (pronounced "be") means "in" or "at", and the noun "אזני" (pronounced "azni") means "ears". Together, they form the phrase "באזני", which means "in my ears" or "of mine ears".

Description: "באזני" is used to express that something is heard or understood by the speaker. It can be used literally to refer to something that is physically heard by the ears, or figuratively to express understanding or agreement with something.
