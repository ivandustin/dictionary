Etymology: The word "באהלו" (pronounced "ba'ahlo") is a Hebrew word that combines two elements. "באהל" (pronounced "ba'ohel") means "tent" in Hebrew, and "ו" (pronounced "vav") is a conjunction meaning "and." Therefore, "באהלו" can be translated as "in his tent" or "in the tent of him."

Grammar: "באהלו" is a possessive phrase in Hebrew, indicating that something belongs to or is associated with a male person. The word "באהל" (tent) is modified by the possessive suffix "ו" (his/him), indicating ownership or association.

Description: "באהלו" is a phrase that can be used to describe a location or situation where someone is in a tent. It can also be used metaphorically to refer to someone's personal space or domain.
