Etymology: The word "באלהיכם" (pronounced "ba'alheichem") is a Hebrew word that combines two elements. "באל" (ba'al) means "in the possession of" or "belonging to," and "היכם" (heichem) means "your gods." Therefore, "באלהיכם" can be translated as "in the possession of your gods" or "belonging to your gods."

Grammar: "באלהיכם" is a compound word in Hebrew, consisting of the preposition "ב" (ba), meaning "in" or "belonging to," and the noun "אלהיכם" (elohaychem), meaning "your gods." The word is in the plural form, indicating that it refers to multiple gods.

Description: "באלהיכם" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to foreign gods or idols worshiped by the Israelites' neighbors. It is often used in a negative context, emphasizing the prohibition of worshiping other gods besides the God of Israel. The word highlights the idea that these gods are not the true God and should not be revered or followed.
