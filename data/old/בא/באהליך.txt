Etymology: The word "באהליך" (ba'ahalikh) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב.א.ה (b.a.h), which means "to enter" or "to come." The suffix ליך (likh) is a possessive pronoun meaning "your" or "yours." Therefore, "באהליך" can be translated as "in your tent" or "in your dwelling."

Grammar: "באהליך" is a prepositional phrase composed of the preposition "ב" (be), meaning "in," and the noun "אהליך" (ohaleikh), meaning "your tent" or "your dwelling." The word "אהליך" is formed by adding the possessive suffix "יך" (ekh) to the noun "אהל" (ohel), which means "tent" or "dwelling."

Description: "באהליך" is used in Hebrew to refer to someone being in or entering another person's tent or dwelling. It can be used literally to describe physical presence in a tent or dwelling, or metaphorically to express being in someone's personal space or being close to them.
