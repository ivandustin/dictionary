Grammar: "באלפו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" indicates location or possession, and the noun "אלף" functions as the object of the preposition. The suffix "ו" (pronounced "o") indicates the third person singular possessive form, meaning "his" or "its." Therefore, "באלפו" can be translated as "in his thousand" or "at its thousand."
