Etymology: The word "בכפיהם" (b'kafayhem) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "ב" (b) means "in" or "with," and "כפיהם" (kafayhem) is a combination of two words: "כף" (kaf), which means "palm" or "hand," and "ים" (yam), which is a plural suffix indicating possession. Therefore, "בכפיהם" can be translated as "in their hands" or "with their hands."

The noun "כף" (kaf) is in the construct state, indicating possession, and it is followed by the plural suffix "ים" (yam) to indicate possession by multiple individuals.
