Etymology: The word "בכרתך" (bikurtecha) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-כ-ר (b-k-r), which means "firstborn" or "first fruits." The suffix תך (-techa) indicates possession, so בכרתך (bikurtecha) can be translated as "your firstborn" or "your first fruits."

Grammar: בכרתך (bikurtecha) is a noun in the singular form. It is a possessive noun, indicating possession of the firstborn or first fruits. In Hebrew, nouns can have different forms depending on gender, number, and possession.

Description: בכרתך (bikurtecha) refers to the firstborn or first fruits. In Jewish tradition, the firstborn holds a special status and is often associated with certain rights and responsibilities. The first fruits, on the other hand, are the initial harvest of agricultural produce, which were traditionally offered as a thanksgiving offering to God.
