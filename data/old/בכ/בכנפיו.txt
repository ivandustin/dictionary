Etymology: The word "בכנפיו" (bekanfeav) is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "on its wings" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew words "ב" (be), meaning "on" or "in," and "כנף" (kanaf), meaning "wing."

Grammar: "בכנפיו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (be) indicates location or direction, and "כנף" (kanaf) is a noun meaning "wing." The suffix "יו" (av) indicates possession, so "בכנפיו" can be translated as "on its wings" or "in its wings."

Description: "בכנפיו" is a poetic phrase used in Hebrew literature and religious texts. It is often used metaphorically to describe protection, shelter, or guidance. The phrase suggests the image of a bird spreading its wings to provide cover or support.
