Etymology: The word "חורם" (pronounced "choram" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root ח.ר.ם (ch.r.m), which means "to dedicate" or "to consecrate". 

Grammar: "חורם" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe a person who is under a religious ban or curse. It is also used to refer to an object that is dedicated or consecrated for religious purposes.

Description: In Jewish tradition, a "חורם" is someone or something that is set apart or devoted to God. This can be a person who has been excommunicated or banned from the community due to their actions, or an object that has been consecrated for use in religious rituals. The concept of "חורם" is rooted in the idea of separating the sacred from the profane and maintaining the purity of religious practices.
