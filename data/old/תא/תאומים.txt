Etymology: The word "תאומים" (ta'omim) is a Hebrew word that means "twins". It is derived from the Hebrew root תאם (ta'am), which means "to pair" or "to match".

Grammar: "תאומים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a pair of twins, two individuals who are born from the same pregnancy and share a close genetic relationship.

Description: Twins are two individuals who are born at the same time from the same pregnancy. They can be either identical twins, who share the same genetic material and look very similar, or fraternal twins, who are born from two separate eggs and may or may not resemble each other. Twins are relatively common in human populations, and their occurrence can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors.
