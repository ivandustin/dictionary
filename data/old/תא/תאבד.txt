Etymology: The word "תאבד" (pronounced "ta'aved" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root אבד, which means "to be lost" or "to perish". The prefix ת- (ta-) indicates the future tense, so תאבד means "you will be lost" or "you will perish".

Grammar: תאבד is the second person singular future tense form of the verb אבד. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to the subject and tense. The prefix ת- (ta-) indicates the second person singular (you), and the root אבד remains unchanged.

Description: תאבד is a verb in Hebrew that expresses the future tense of the action of being lost or perishing. It is used to describe the state of someone or something being lost or destroyed in the future.
