Etymology: The word "תאסף" (pronounced "ta'asaf" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root ספף (s-p-p), which means "to gather" or "to collect". The prefix ת- (ta) indicates the future tense, so תאסף means "you will gather" or "you will collect".

Grammar: תאסף is the second person singular future tense form of the verb ספף (s-p-p). In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject and the tense. The prefix ת- (ta) indicates the second person singular (you), and the root ספף (s-p-p) remains unchanged.

Description: תאסף is a verb in Hebrew that means "you will gather" or "you will collect". It is used to express an action that will happen in the future.
