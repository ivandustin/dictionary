Etymology: The word "כְּמֻצוֹת" (kemutzot) is derived from the Hebrew root כָּמַץ (kamatz), which means "to ferment" or "to leaven." It is related to the Passover holiday, during which the consumption of leavened bread is prohibited.

Grammar: "כְּמֻצוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is the plural form of "כְּמֵץ" (kemetz), which means "leaven" or "fermented dough." The word is used to refer to the unleavened bread that is traditionally eaten during the Passover holiday.

Description: "כְּמֻצוֹת" refers to the unleavened bread that is eaten during the Jewish holiday of Passover. It is a flat, cracker-like bread made from flour and water, without any leavening agents. The consumption of leavened bread is prohibited during Passover, and instead, "כְּמֻצוֹת" is eaten to commemorate the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt, when they did not have time to let their bread rise.
