Description: "כמץ" is a substance used in baking to make dough rise. It is typically made from a mixture of flour and water that has been allowed to ferment. When added to dough, it releases carbon dioxide gas, which causes the dough to expand and become lighter and fluffier. Leavening agents like כמץ are commonly used in bread-making and other baked goods to create a soft and airy texture.
