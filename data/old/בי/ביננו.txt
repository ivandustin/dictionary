Etymology: The word "ביננו" (pronounced "beinenu") is a Hebrew word that means "between us" or "among us". It is derived from the Hebrew preposition "בֵּין" (pronounced "bein"), which means "between" or "among", and the Hebrew pronoun "אֲנוּ" (pronounced "anu"), which means "we" or "us".

Grammar: "ביננו" is a compound word consisting of the preposition "בֵּין" (bein) and the pronoun "אֲנוּ" (anu). In Hebrew, prepositions are used to indicate relationships between words, and pronouns are used to refer to people or things. The word "ביננו" is used to express a sense of closeness or intimacy among a group of people.

Description: The word "ביננו" is often used in colloquial Hebrew to indicate a shared understanding or secret knowledge among a group of people. It can also be used to imply a sense of exclusivity or confidentiality. For example, if someone says "ביננו דבר" (beinenu davar), it means "between us" or "just between you and me". This phrase is commonly used when someone wants to share something in confidence or discuss a private matter.
