Description: "בידיה" (bidya) is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a specific type of divorce document. In Jewish tradition, a divorce is not considered valid unless it is accompanied by a written document called a "get." The "get" is a legal document that is written by a qualified scribe and given by the husband to the wife to dissolve the marriage. The "בידיה" (bidya) is the physical document itself, which is usually written on parchment and contains the text of the divorce decree. It is an important legal and religious document in Jewish divorce proceedings.
