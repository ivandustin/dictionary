Etymology: The word "בירח" (birch) comes from the Hebrew root ב-ר-ח, which means "to shine" or "to illuminate." It is derived from the noun בִּירָה (birah), meaning "a well" or "a cistern," which was used to store water and keep it fresh. The connection between the root and the noun is that a well or cistern provides water, which is essential for life and therefore "illuminates" or sustains life.
