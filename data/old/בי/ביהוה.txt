Etymology: The word "ביהוה" (pronounced "Biyhohah") is a Hebrew term that consists of two parts. The first part, "ב" (pronounced "be"), is a preposition meaning "in" or "by." The second part, "יהוה" (pronounced "Yahweh" or "YHVH"), is the Hebrew name of God, often translated as "the Lord" or "Yahweh." Therefore, "ביהוה" can be translated as "in God" or "by God."

Grammar: "ביהוה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (be) indicates a location or a state of being, and it is followed by the noun "יהוה" (Yahweh), which refers to God. In Hebrew grammar, prepositional phrases are commonly used to indicate location, possession, or other relationships between words.

Description: The phrase "ביהוה" is often used in religious or spiritual contexts to express a sense of being in the presence of God or relying on God's guidance and support. It can be found in various religious texts and prayers, emphasizing the belief in a higher power and the importance of a spiritual connection.
