It is derived from the noun בִּירָה (birah), which means "a well" or "a cistern." In the context of the word "בירחו," it refers to the shining or illumination of the moon.

Grammar: "בירחו" is a verb in the Hebrew language. It is in the third person masculine singular form of the past tense. The root letters ב-ר-ח (B-R-Ḥ) remain unchanged, and the suffix ו (u) indicates the masculine singular form.

Description: "בירחו" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to describe the action of the moon shining or illuminating. It is often used in the context of the moon's monthly cycle, where it goes from being completely dark (new moon) to gradually increasing in brightness (waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous) until it reaches its full brightness (full moon).
