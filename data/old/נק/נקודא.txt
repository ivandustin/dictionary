Etymology: The word "נְקוּדָה" (Nekudah) comes from the Hebrew root נ.ק.ד (N.K.D), which means "to point" or "to punctuate." It refers to the diacritical marks used in Hebrew writing to indicate vowel sounds.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, "נְקוּדָה" (Nekudah) refers to the vowel points or diacritical marks that are added to the consonants in Hebrew script. These marks indicate the pronunciation of the vowels and help in reading and understanding the text.

Description: "נְקוּדָה" (Nekudah) is an essential aspect of Hebrew writing and reading. It helps to clarify the pronunciation and meaning of words, as Hebrew is primarily a consonantal language. The vowel points are placed above, below, or inside the consonants, and they can change the sound and meaning of a word. Without the vowel points, Hebrew text would be difficult to read and understand.
