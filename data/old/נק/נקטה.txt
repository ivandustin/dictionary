Etymology: The word "נקטה" (Nakta) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root נ-ק-ט, which means "to punctuate" or "to mark." It is derived from the Aramaic word "נקטא" (Nakta), which has a similar meaning.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, "נקטה" (Nakta) is a punctuation mark called a "nun hafucha" or "inverted nun." It is used to indicate a break or interruption in the text, similar to a parenthesis or a dash in English. It is often used to mark off a section of text that is considered separate or distinct from the rest of the sentence.

Description: "נקטה" (Nakta) is a small symbol that looks like an upside-down letter "נ" (nun). It is used in Hebrew texts, particularly in religious texts such as the Torah, to indicate a break or interruption in the text. It is placed above the line of text and is often accompanied by a space before and after it. The purpose of the "נקטה" (Nakta) is to draw attention to the enclosed section of text and to indicate that it should be read separately from the surrounding text.
