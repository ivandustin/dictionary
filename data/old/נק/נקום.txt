Etymology: The word "נְקוּד" (Nekud) comes from the Hebrew root נ.ק.ד (N.K.D), which means "to point" or "to punctuate." It refers to the diacritical marks used in Hebrew writing to indicate vowel sounds.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, "נְקוּד" (Nekud) refers to the system of vowel points or diacritical marks used to indicate vowel sounds in Hebrew texts. These marks are placed above, below, or inside the consonants to provide pronunciation guidance.

Description: "נְקוּד" (Nekud) is an essential component of Hebrew writing and reading. It helps clarify the pronunciation of words and distinguishes between words that would otherwise be spelled the same. Without vowel points, Hebrew text would consist only of consonants, making it difficult to read and understand.
