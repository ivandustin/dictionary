Etymology: The word "נַקְדְּמָה" (naqdemah) is derived from the Hebrew root נקדם (n-q-d-m), which means "to precede" or "to go before." 

Grammar: נַקְדְּמָה is a feminine noun in the singular form. It is used in the Hebrew language to refer to a punctuation mark called "semicolon" in English. 

Description: The נַקְדְּמָה (semicolon) is a punctuation mark that is used to separate two closely related independent clauses in a sentence. It indicates a stronger separation than a comma but a weaker separation than a period. The נַקְדְּמָה is commonly used to connect two related thoughts or ideas within a sentence.
