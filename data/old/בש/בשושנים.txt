Etymology: The word "בְּשׁוֹשְׁנִים" (beshoshanim) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שׁ.נ.ן (sh.n.n), which means "to be bright, radiant, or shining." It is derived from the noun שׁוֹשַׁן (shoshan), which means "lily" or "rose." 

Grammar: "בְּשׁוֹשְׁנִים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the root word שׁוֹשַׁן (shoshan). The prefix בְּ (be) means "in" or "with." Therefore, the word can be translated as "in lilies" or "with lilies."

Description: "בְּשׁוֹשְׁנִים" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Song of Solomon 2:2, 2:16, 5:13) to describe the beauty and fragrance of lilies. It is often interpreted metaphorically to represent love, beauty, or purity.
