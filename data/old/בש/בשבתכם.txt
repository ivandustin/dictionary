Etymology: The word "בְּשֵׁבֶת" (beshavet) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שבת (shavat), which means "to rest" or "to cease." It is derived from the Hebrew noun שַׁבָּת (shabbat), which refers to the Jewish day of rest.

Grammar: "בְּשֵׁבֶת" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition בְּ (be) means "in" or "during," and the noun שֵׁבֶת (shavet) means "rest" or "cessation." Together, the phrase means "in rest" or "during rest."

Description: The word "בְּשֵׁבֶת" is used to describe an action or state that occurs during the period of rest or cessation.
