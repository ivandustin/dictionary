Etymology: The word "בְּשָׁלוּתִית" comes from the Hebrew root שׁ.ל.וּת (sh.l.u.t), which means "to be cooked" or "to be prepared." The prefix בְּ (be) indicates "in" or "with," and the suffix יִת (it) denotes a feminine adjective. Therefore, בְּשָׁלוּתִית can be translated as "in a cooked/prepared manner" or "cooked/prepared."

Grammar: בְּשָׁלוּתִית is a feminine adjective in the singular form. It agrees with a feminine noun it modifies. In Hebrew, adjectives usually follow the noun they modify.

The word can also be used metaphorically to describe something that is well thought out or well planned.
