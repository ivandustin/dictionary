Etymology: The word "בְּשׁוֹפְרוֹת" (b'shofrot) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שׁ.פ.ר (sh.p.r), which means "to blow" or "to sound". It is derived from the noun שׁוֹפָר (shofar), which refers to a ram's horn used as a musical instrument in Jewish religious ceremonies.

Grammar: "בְּשׁוֹפְרוֹת" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition בְּ (b') means "in" or "with", and the noun שׁוֹפְרוֹת (shofrot) is the plural form of שׁוֹפָר (shofar). The word order in Hebrew is different from English, so the preposition comes before the noun.

Description: "בְּשׁוֹפְרוֹת" is used to describe the act of blowing or sounding the shofar. It can be used in various contexts, such as during religious services, celebrations, or rituals. The shofar is an important symbol in Jewish culture and is associated with various religious observances, including Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement).
