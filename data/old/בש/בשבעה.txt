Etymology: The word "בְּשֵׁבֶת" (beshavet) is derived from the Hebrew root "שבת" (shavat), which means "to rest" or "to cease." It is related to the Hebrew word "שַׁבָּת" (Shabbat), which refers to the Jewish day of rest.

Grammar: "בְּשֵׁבֶת" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. It consists of the preposition "בְּ" (be), which means "in" or "on," and the noun "שֵׁבֶת" (shavet), which means "rest" or "cessation." Together, they form the phrase "in rest" or "on rest."
