Etymology: The word "בשמהם" is a Hebrew word that consists of four letters: ב (bet), ש (shin), ה (hey), and ם (final mem). It is derived from the root בשם (b-sh-m), which means "in the name of" or "by the name of" in Hebrew.

Grammar: "בשמהם" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word "ב" (bet) means "in" or "by," and "שמהם" (shem-hem) is a compound word that means "their name." The suffix "הם" (hem) indicates the plural form of the pronoun "they" or "them." Therefore, "בשמהם" can be translated as "in their name" or "by their name."

Description: "בשמהם" is used in Hebrew to refer to something that is done or said on behalf of a group of people, with their authorization or in their name. It is often used in legal or official contexts to indicate that an action or statement is being done or made on behalf of a specific group or organization.
