Etymology: The word "בְּשִׁנְיוֹ" (beshinuyo) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שנה (shinah), which means "to change" or "to alter." The prefix בְּ (be) indicates "in" or "with," and the suffix יוֹ (yo) is a possessive pronoun meaning "his." Therefore, בְּשִׁנְיוֹ can be translated as "in his change" or "with his alteration."

Grammar: בְּשִׁנְיוֹ is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix בְּ (be) functions as a preposition, indicating the relationship between the noun and the verb. The root שנה (shinah) is a verb that has been transformed into a noun by adding the possessive suffix יוֹ (yo).

It can refer to a physical change, such as a change in appearance or condition, or a more abstract change, such as a change in attitude or perspective. The word emphasizes that the change is specific to the person being referred to.
