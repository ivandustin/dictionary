Description: "תרומת" is a biblical term that refers to a voluntary offering or contribution. In the Hebrew Bible, it specifically refers to the portion of agricultural produce that was set aside and given to the priests or Levites as a form of support. This offering was considered holy and was separate from the regular tithes and taxes.

Today, the term "תרומת" is still used in Hebrew to refer to various types of voluntary contributions or donations, both in religious and secular contexts. It can also be used metaphorically to describe any kind of offering or contribution that is given willingly and with a sense of dedication.
