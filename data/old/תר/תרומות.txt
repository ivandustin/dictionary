Etymology: The word "תְּרוּמוֹת" (terumot) is a Hebrew word derived from the root ר-ו-מ (R-W-M), which means "to lift up" or "to elevate." It is related to the word תְּרוּמָה (terumah), which means "offering" or "contribution."

Grammar: "תְּרוּמוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is the plural form of תְּרוּמָה (terumah). In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The plural form of תְּרוּמָה is formed by adding the suffix וֹת (-ot) to the singular form.

Description: "תְּרוּמוֹת" refers to the biblical concept of "offerings" or "contributions" that were given by the Israelites to support the priests and the Tabernacle (later the Temple) in ancient times. These offerings were voluntary and were used for various purposes, including the maintenance of the religious services and the support of the priests and Levites. The concept of terumot is still relevant in Jewish religious practice today, although it is no longer practiced in the same way as in ancient times.
