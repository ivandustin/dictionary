Etymology: The Hebrew word "הושמע" (pronounced "hoshmea") comes from the root שמע (sh-m-a), which means "to hear" or "to listen." The prefix ה (ha) means "the," so הושמע can be translated as "the one who hears" or "the listener."

Grammar: הושמע is a noun in the masculine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The plural form of הושמע is הושמעים (hoshme'im).

Description: הושמע is a term used in Jewish tradition to refer to someone who is called up to the Torah during a synagogue service. The person who is called up reads a portion of the Torah aloud, and the congregation listens to the reading. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to someone who is attentive and listens carefully.
