Etymology: The word "הוציאני" (pronounced "hotzi'ani") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root יצא (pronounced "yatsa"), which means "to go out" or "to bring out." The word is formed by adding the prefix ה- (pronounced "ha-"), which means "the," and the suffix ני (pronounced "ni"), which is a first-person singular pronoun suffix meaning "me" or "myself."

Grammar: "הוציאני" is a verb in the past tense, third-person masculine singular form. It is derived from the verb הוציא (pronounced "hotzi'"), which means "he brought out" or "he took out." The suffix ני (pronounced "ni") indicates that the action was done to the speaker, so "הוציאני" can be translated as "he brought me out" or "he took me out."

Description: "הוציאני" is a Hebrew word that expresses the idea of being brought out or taken out by someone. It can be used in various contexts, such as being physically brought out of a place or situation, or being figuratively brought out of a state of distress or difficulty.
