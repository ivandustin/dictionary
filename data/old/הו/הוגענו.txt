Etymology: The word "הוגענו" (pronounced "hogenu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ה.ג.ע (h.g.a), which means "to touch" or "to reach." The word is formed by adding the prefix ה- (ha), which means "the," and the suffix -נו (-nu), which means "our." Therefore, הוגענו can be translated as "our touch" or "our reach."
