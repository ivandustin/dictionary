Description: "בפידו" (bepido) is a term used in Jewish law to refer to the act of redeeming a firstborn son. According to Jewish tradition, the firstborn son is considered holy and must be redeemed by the father. This is done by giving a certain amount of money or an equivalent value to a Kohen (a descendant of the priestly tribe of Levi). The purpose of this redemption is to symbolize that the child belongs to God and to commemorate the redemption of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.
