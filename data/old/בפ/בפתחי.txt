Etymology: The word "בפתחי" (biftehi) is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts: "בפתח" (bifto'ach) and "י" (yod). "בפתח" means "at the entrance" or "at the threshold," and "י" is a possessive pronoun that means "my." Therefore, "בפתחי" can be translated as "at my entrance" or "at my threshold."

Grammar: "בפתחי" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. It is composed of the preposition "ב" (be), which means "at" or "in," and the noun "פתח" (petaḥ), which means "entrance" or "threshold." The suffix "י" (i) is added to the noun to indicate possession, making it "my entrance" or "my threshold."

Description: "בפתחי" is a phrase that is often used metaphorically in Hebrew to express a state of readiness or preparedness. It can be used to describe being at the beginning or starting point of something, or being on the verge of a new experience or opportunity.
