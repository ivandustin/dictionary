Etymology: The word "בפניו" (pronounced "bifnei") is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "in his face" or "before him." It is composed of the preposition "ב" (pronounced "be") meaning "in" or "at," and the noun "פנים" (pronounced "panim") meaning "face."

Grammar: "בפניו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" indicates location or direction, and it is followed by the noun "פנים" in the construct state. The construct state is used to show a possessive relationship between two nouns, in this case, "פנים" (face) and a third-person possessive pronoun.

Description: The phrase "בפניו" is used to describe something that is directly in front of someone or happening right in front of their face. It can be used both literally and figuratively to convey the idea of something being obvious, apparent, or undeniable.
