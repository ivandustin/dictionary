Etymology: The word "בפניה" (pronounced "b'paniya") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פנה (pronounced "panah"), which means "to turn" or "to face." The prefix ב (pronounced "b") indicates "in" or "with." Therefore, "בפניה" can be translated as "in her face" or "with her face."

Grammar: "בפניה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition ב (pronounced "b") means "in" or "with," and פניה (pronounced "paniya") is the feminine singular form of the noun פנים (pronounced "panim"), which means "face." The suffix ה (pronounced "ha") indicates possession, so פניה means "her face."

Description: "בפניה" is used to describe a situation or action that is done directly in front of someone or with their involvement. It can be used literally to refer to something happening in front of a person's face, or figuratively to describe a situation where someone is directly involved or affected.
