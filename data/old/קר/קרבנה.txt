Description: In Jewish tradition, a "קרבנה" (karbanah) refers to a sacrificial offering brought to the Temple in Jerusalem as an act of worship. These offerings were an integral part of ancient Israelite religious practice and were believed to bring individuals closer to God. Different types of offerings were prescribed for various occasions and purposes, including thanksgiving, atonement, and dedication. The practice of offering sacrifices ceased with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. Today, prayer and acts of kindness are considered to be the spiritual equivalents of the ancient sacrificial offerings.
