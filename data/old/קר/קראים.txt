Etymology: The word "קראים" (pronounced "karaim") is derived from the Hebrew root ק.ר.א (k.r.a), which means "to read" or "to call." It is related to the Hebrew word קָרָא (kara), which means "he called" or "he read."

Grammar: "קראים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is the plural form of the word "קראי" (karai), which means "Karaites" in English. In Hebrew, nouns have different forms for singular and plural, and the plural form is used when referring to more than one person or thing.

Description: The term "קראים" refers to a Jewish religious movement known as Karaism. Karaites reject the authority of the Talmud and other rabbinic writings, and instead focus on the Hebrew Bible as the sole source of religious law. They emphasize the importance of individual interpretation and direct engagement with the biblical text. The Karaites have their own unique traditions, customs, and practices that differ from mainstream Judaism.
