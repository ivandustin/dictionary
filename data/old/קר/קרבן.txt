Etymology: The word "קרבן" (pronounced "korban") comes from the Hebrew root ק-ר-ב (k-r-b), which means "to come near" or "to approach." In ancient Hebrew, it referred to an offering or sacrifice brought to the Temple in Jerusalem as a means of drawing closer to God.

Grammar: "קרבן" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is singular and can be used in both the singular and plural forms. In the plural form, it becomes "קרבנות" (korbanot).

Description: In Jewish tradition, a "קרבן" is an offering or sacrifice that was brought to the Temple in Jerusalem as an act of worship and atonement. It was a central part of the religious rituals and practices in ancient Israel. Different types of offerings were prescribed for various occasions, including burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. The purpose of these offerings was to express devotion to God, seek forgiveness for sins, and maintain a relationship with the divine.

With the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, the practice of bringing physical sacrifices ceased. However, the concept of "קרבן" continues to hold symbolic and spiritual significance in Jewish prayer and religious observance. Today, prayers and acts of charity are often seen as spiritual substitutes for the physical offerings of the past.
