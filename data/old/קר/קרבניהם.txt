Etymology: The word "קַרְבָּנִים" (karbanim) is derived from the Hebrew root קְרֵב (kerev), which means "to come near" or "to approach." It is related to the concept of bringing offerings to the altar in the ancient Hebrew sacrificial system.

Grammar: "קַרְבָּנִים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the root קְרֵב (kerev). The word is used to refer to various types of offerings or sacrifices brought to the Temple in ancient times.

Description: In Jewish tradition, "קַרְבָּנִים" refers to the animal sacrifices that were offered on the altar in the Temple in Jerusalem. These sacrifices were an integral part of the religious rituals and were believed to bring atonement for sins and establish a connection between the worshipper and God. The types of offerings included burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings, among others. The sacrificial system played a central role in ancient Israelite worship until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. Today, in the absence of the Temple, prayer and acts of kindness are considered as substitutes for the physical sacrifices.
