Etymology: The word "פדיתים" (pronounced "pedityim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פ.ד.ה (P.D.H), which means "to redeem" or "to ransom." It is derived from the noun פדיון (pidyon), which means "redemption" or "ransom."

Grammar: "פדיתים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the root word פדיון (pidyon). The plural form is used to refer to multiple instances of redemption or ransoms.

Description: "פדיתים" refers to redemptions or ransoms. In Jewish law and tradition, it specifically refers to the redemption of a firstborn son. According to Jewish law, a firstborn son is considered to be consecrated to God and must be redeemed by the parents. This redemption is done by giving a certain amount of money or equivalent value to a Kohen (a descendant of the priestly tribe of Levi). The Kohen then represents the redemption of the child from his consecration to God.
