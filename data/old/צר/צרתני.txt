Etymology: The word "צרתני" comes from the Hebrew root צרה (tsarah), which means "trouble" or "distress". The suffix תני (-tani) is added to the root to form an adjective, meaning "causing trouble" or "troublesome".

Grammar: צרתני is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: צרתני describes something or someone that causes trouble or is troublesome. It can be used to describe a difficult situation, a challenging person, or any other source of distress or annoyance.
