Etymology: The word "צרוע" (tzaru'a) comes from the Hebrew root צ-ר-ע (ts-r-a), which means "to be afflicted" or "to be struck." 

Grammar: "צרוע" is a noun in the masculine form. It is used to describe a person who has a skin disease called "צרעת" (tzara'at) in Hebrew. In English, it is often translated as "leper."

Description: In biblical times, "צרעת" (tzara'at) was a serious skin disease that affected not only the physical health of a person but also their social and religious status. A person with tzara'at was considered unclean and had to live outside the community until they were declared clean by a priest. The laws regarding tzara'at can be found in the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Bible.
