Etymology: The word "להית" (lehite) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "הית" (hayah), which means "to be" or "to exist". The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew often indicates the infinitive form of a verb, so "להית" can be understood as "to be" or "to exist".

Grammar: "להית" is a verb in the Hebrew language. It is in the infinitive form, which means it is not conjugated to a specific tense, gender, or number. In Hebrew, verbs are often conjugated to match the subject of the sentence.
