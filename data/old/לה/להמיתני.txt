Etymology: The word "להמיתני" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "מות" (mavet), which means "death" in Hebrew. The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew is often used to indicate the infinitive form of a verb, so "להמיתני" can be translated as "to kill me" or "to cause my death."

Grammar: "להמיתני" is a verb phrase in Hebrew. It consists of the infinitive form of the verb "להמית" (lehameet), which means "to kill," and the pronoun "ני" (ni), which means "me." The verb is conjugated in the causative form, indicating that the subject is causing the action of killing.

Description: "להמיתני" is a strong and intense expression in Hebrew, conveying a strong desire or request for someone to cause one's death. It can be used figuratively to express extreme frustration, despair, or a desire to escape a difficult situation. However, it is important to note that this phrase should not be taken literally, as it is not a healthy or appropriate way to express one's emotions. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it is important to seek help from a mental health professional or a helpline in your country.
