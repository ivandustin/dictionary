Etymology: The word "אביך" (pronounced "avich") is a Hebrew word that means "your father." It is derived from the Hebrew root א-ב-ה (aleph-bet-heh), which means "father."

Grammar: "אביך" is a possessive form of the word "אב" (av), which means "father." In Hebrew, possessive forms are created by adding the suffix "-ך" (-ech) to the noun. The suffix "-ך" (-ech) indicates the second person singular possessive, meaning "your" in English.

Description: "אביך" is used to refer to someone's father in the second person singular possessive form. It is commonly used in Hebrew to address or talk about someone's father when speaking directly to that person.
