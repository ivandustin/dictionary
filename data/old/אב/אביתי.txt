Etymology: The word "אביתי" (pronounced "aviti") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אב (av), which means "father" in Hebrew. The suffix י (i) is added to indicate possession or belonging, so אביתי can be translated as "my father's" or "belonging to my father."

Grammar: אביתי is a possessive adjective in Hebrew. It is used to indicate possession or belonging to the speaker's father. In Hebrew, possessive adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. For example, אביתי is masculine singular, so it would be used to describe a singular masculine noun belonging to the speaker's father.

Description: אביתי is a term of endearment or affection used to refer to something that belongs to or is associated with the speaker's father. It can be used to express a sense of pride or attachment to one's father.
