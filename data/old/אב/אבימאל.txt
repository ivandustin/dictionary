Etymology: The word "אבימאל" (pronounced "Avimal") is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. "אב" (pronounced "av") means "father" in Hebrew, and "מאל" (pronounced "mal") is a shortened form of the Hebrew word "מאלאך" (pronounced "mal'ach"), which means "angel". Therefore, the name "אבימאל" can be translated as "father of angels" or "angelic father".

Grammar: In Hebrew, "אבימאל" is a masculine proper noun. It consists of three syllables: א-בי-מאל. The first syllable, א- (pronounced "av"), means "father". The second syllable, בי- (pronounced "bi"), is a possessive pronoun meaning "my". The third syllable, מאל (pronounced "mal"), means "angel". When combined, the name "אבימאל" means "my father is an angel" or "my angelic father".

Description: "אבימאל" is a unique and meaningful name in Hebrew. It carries a sense of divine connection and protection, as it combines the concept of a father figure with that of an angel. This name may be given to a person as a way to express their special relationship with a higher power or to honor a spiritual connection.
