Etymology: The word "חֳדֶשׁ" (chodesh) comes from the Hebrew root ח־ד־שׁ, which means "new" or "renew." It is related to the word חִידוּשׁ (chidush), which means "innovation" or "novelty."

Grammar: In Hebrew, חֳדֶשׁ is a masculine noun. It is usually used in the singular form, but it can also be used in the plural form חֳדָשִׁים (chodashim). It can be modified by adjectives or determiners to indicate specific months or time periods.

Description: חֳדֶשׁ means "month" in Hebrew. It is used to refer to the lunar month in the Hebrew calendar, which is based on the cycles of the moon. The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning it combines both lunar and solar elements to determine the dates of holidays and other important events. Each month in the Hebrew calendar begins with the sighting of the new moon.
