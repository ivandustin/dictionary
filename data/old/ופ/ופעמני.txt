Etymology: The word "ופעמני" (pronounced "ufa'ameni") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פעם (pa'am), which means "time" or "occasion". The prefix ו- (vav) means "and", and the suffix ני (-ni) is a possessive suffix that means "my". So, ופעמני literally means "and my time" or "and my occasion".

Grammar: ופעמני is a noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender, and ופעמני is masculine. It is also in the construct state, which means it is used to indicate possession or relationship with another noun. In this case, ופעמני is used to describe or specify a noun that follows it.
