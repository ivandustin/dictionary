Etymology: The word "וְפָנוּאֵל" (pronounced "vefanoel") is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. "וְ" (pronounced "ve") means "and" in Hebrew, and "פָנוּאֵל" (pronounced "fanoel") is a compound word made up of two parts: "פָנָה" (pronounced "fana") meaning "face" or "appearance," and "אֵל" (pronounced "el") meaning "God." Therefore, the name "וְפָנוּאֵל" can be translated as "and the face of God" or "and the appearance of God."

Grammar: "וְפָנוּאֵל" is a proper noun in Hebrew, specifically a masculine name. It is composed of two words, "וְ" (meaning "and") and "פָנוּאֵל" (meaning "the face of God"). In Hebrew, proper nouns are not declined or conjugated like regular nouns or verbs.

Description: "וְפָנוּאֵל" is a biblical name that appears in the Old Testament. It is mentioned in the book of Genesis, chapter 32, verse 30, where Jacob wrestles with an angel and says, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." The name "וְפָנוּאֵל" is often interpreted as a symbol of Jacob's encounter with God and his transformation.
