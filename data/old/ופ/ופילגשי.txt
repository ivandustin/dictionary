The prefix "וְ" (pronounced "ve") means "and" and is used to connect the word to the possessive pronoun "my." The root word "פָּלַג" is modified to form the noun "פִּילְגְּשִׁי" by adding the suffix "-י" (pronounced "-i") which indicates possession.

Description: In the context of the Hebrew Bible, a "וְפִילְגְּשִׁי" refers to a secondary wife or concubine. In ancient Hebrew society, it was common for men to have multiple wives or concubines. While the primary wife held a higher status, the concubine was a secondary wife who had fewer rights and privileges. The term "וְפִילְגְּשִׁי" is used to describe a specific relationship between a man and a woman, indicating that she is not his primary wife.
