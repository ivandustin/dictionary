Etymology: The word "ופיהם" (v'fihem) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "ו" (vav) meaning "and" and "פיהם" (fihem) meaning "their mouths". 

Grammar: "ופיהם" is a combination of a conjunction ("ו") and a noun ("פיהם"). The conjunction "ו" is used to connect words or phrases, and in this case, it means "and". The noun "פיהם" is the plural form of "פה" (peh), which means "mouth". So, "ופיהם" translates to "and their mouths".

Description: "ופיהם" is used in Hebrew to refer to a group of people or entities and emphasizes that each individual in the group has their own mouth. It can be used to highlight the collective voice or opinions of a group.
