Description: In the Hebrew Bible, a "וִפְלַגְשִׁים" (viflagshim) refers to a concubine or a secondary wife. Unlike a full wife, a concubine had a lower social status and fewer rights. Concubines were often taken by men in addition to their primary wives and were considered to be part of the household. The practice of having concubines was more common in ancient times but is not widely practiced today.
