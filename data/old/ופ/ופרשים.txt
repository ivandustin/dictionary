Grammar: "וּפָרְשִׁים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the root פָּרָשָׁה (parashah). The prefix וּ (u) means "and" and is used to connect the word to another word or phrase.

Description: "וּפָרְשִׁים" is commonly used to refer to the weekly Torah portions that are read in synagogues on Shabbat (Sabbath) and during Jewish holidays. Each week, a different portion of the Torah is read, and these portions are divided into sections called "וּפָרְשִׁים." The word can also be used more generally to refer to any section or portion of a text.
