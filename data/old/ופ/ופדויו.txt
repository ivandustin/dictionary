Etymology: The word "וֹפְדוּיו" comes from the Hebrew root פדה (p-d-h), which means "to redeem" or "to ransom." It is derived from the noun פְּדוּת (pedut), meaning "redemption" or "ransom."

Grammar: "וֹפְדוּיו" is a Hebrew noun in the masculine form. It is the plural form of the word "וֹפְדִי" (p-d-i), which means "redeemer" or "ransomer." The suffix וֹיו (o-yo) indicates possession, so "וֹפְדוּיו" can be translated as "his redeemers" or "his ransomers."

Description: "וֹפְדוּיו" refers to a group of individuals who redeem or ransom someone or something. In biblical contexts, it is often used to describe God as the ultimate redeemer or savior of the Israelites.
