Etymology: The word "וְפָנִיאֵל" (pronounced "vefani'el") is a Hebrew name that is composed of two parts. The first part, "וְ" (pronounced "ve"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "פָנִיאֵל" (pronounced "fani'el"), is a compound word made up of two elements: "פָנִים" (pronounced "panim"), meaning "face," and "אֵל" (pronounced "el"), meaning "God." Therefore, the name "וְפָנִיאֵל" can be translated as "and the face of God" or "God's face."
