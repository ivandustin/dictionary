Etymology: The word "רחבעם" (pronounced "Rachav'am" in Hebrew) is a Hebrew name that is derived from two elements: "רחב" (pronounced "rachav") meaning "wide" or "broad," and "עם" (pronounced "am") meaning "people" or "nation." Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "wide or broad people" or "expanding nation."

Grammar: "רחבעם" is a masculine proper noun in Hebrew. It is commonly used as a given name for boys.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, "רחבעם" refers to the son of King Solomon and the grandson of King David. He succeeded his father as the king of the united Kingdom of Israel but is known for his oppressive rule, which led to the division of the kingdom into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah.
