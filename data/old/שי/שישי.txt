Etymology: The word "שישי" (pronounced "shishi") comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the Hebrew word "שש" (pronounced "shesh"), which means "six". The suffix "-י" is added to indicate that it is the ordinal number for "sixth".

Grammar: "שישי" is an adjective in Hebrew, used to describe the sixth item in a series. It agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies. For example, if you want to say "the sixth day", you would say "הַיּוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁי" (ha-yom ha-shishi) for a masculine noun, or "הַיּוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁית" (ha-yom ha-shishit) for a feminine noun.

Description: "שישי" is used to indicate the position of something in a sequence, specifically as the sixth item. It can be used to describe days of the week, months, or any other ordered series. For example, "יוֹם שִּׁשִּׁי" (yom shishi) means "Friday", and "חֹדֶשׁ שִּׁשִּׁי" (chodesh shishi) means "June".
