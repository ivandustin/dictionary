Etymology: The word "שיריך" (pronounced "shiricha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ש-י-ר, which means "to sing" or "to chant." It is derived from the noun שיר (shir), which means "song" or "poem."

Grammar: "שיריך" is a masculine plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix יך (-eich) to the root שיר. The suffix יך is used to indicate possession or ownership, so "שיריך" can be translated as "your songs" or "your poems" in English.
