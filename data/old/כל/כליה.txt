Etymology: The word "כְּלִיָּה" (k'liyah) comes from the Hebrew root כְּלִי (k'li), which means "vessel" or "instrument." It is derived from the verb כָּלָה (kalah), meaning "to complete" or "to finish."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "כְּלִיָּה" is a noun that is used to refer to the kidneys. It is a masculine noun and is usually used in the plural form, כְּלָיוֹת (k'layot).

Description: The kidneys are a pair of organs located in the back of the abdomen, on either side of the spine. They play a crucial role in filtering waste products and excess fluid from the blood, producing urine, and maintaining the body's electrolyte balance. The kidneys also help regulate blood pressure and produce hormones that stimulate the production of red blood cells.
