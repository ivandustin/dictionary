Etymology: The word "לתולדתם" is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "תולדה" (toldah), which means "generation" or "descendants". The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew often indicates "to" or "for", so "לתולדתם" can be translated as "for their generations" or "to their descendants".

Grammar: "לתולדתם" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (lamed) indicates direction or purpose, and it is followed by the noun "תולדתם" (toldatam), which means "their generations" or "their descendants". The suffix "ם" (mem) indicates the plural possessive form, so "תולדתם" refers to the generations or descendants of a group of people.
