The word "לתהלה" is a Hebrew word that can be translated as "etymology" in English. It is derived from the root word "תהלה" which means "praise" or "glory". In Hebrew, "ל" is a preposition that means "to" or "for", so "לתהלה" can be understood as "to praise" or "for glory". 

In terms of grammar, "לתהלה" is a noun phrase composed of the preposition "ל" and the noun "תהלה". In Hebrew, nouns are usually formed by adding a suffix to the root word, and in this case, the suffix "ה" is added to the root "תהלה" to form the noun "תהלה". 

In a broader sense, "לתהלה" can also be used to describe something that is praiseworthy or deserving of glory. It can be used to express admiration or appreciation for someone or something.
