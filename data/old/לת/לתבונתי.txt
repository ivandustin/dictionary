Etymology: The word "לתבונתי" is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "לתבונה" (le'tevuna) and "תי" (ti). "לתבונה" means "for understanding" or "for comprehension" and "תי" is a suffix that indicates possession or belonging. Therefore, "לתבונתי" can be translated as "for my understanding" or "for my comprehension."

Grammar: "לתבונתי" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (le) means "for" or "to" and is followed by the noun "תבונה" (tevuna), which means "understanding" or "comprehension." The possessive suffix "י" (i) is added to the noun to indicate possession by the first person singular pronoun "אני" (ani), meaning "I." Therefore, "לתבונתי" is translated as "for my understanding" or "for my comprehension."
