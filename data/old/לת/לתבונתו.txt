Grammar: "לתבונתו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (le) means "for" or "to," and it is followed by the noun "תבונה" (tevuna), which means "understanding" or "comprehension." The suffix "ו" (o) indicates possession, so "תבונתו" means "his understanding" or "his comprehension."

Description: The phrase "לתבונתו" is often used in Hebrew to express that something is done or provided for the purpose of someone's understanding or comprehension. It emphasizes the importance of clarity and comprehension in a given context.
