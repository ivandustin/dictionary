Etymology: The word "יצאתם" (pronounced "yatz'atem") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root יצא (pronounced "yatz'a"), which means "to go out" or "to exit." The suffix תם (pronounced "tam") is added to the root to indicate the second person plural form of the verb, making it mean "you (plural) went out" or "you (plural) exited."

Grammar: "יצאתם" is a verb in the past tense, second person plural form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject, tense, and number. In this case, the verb is conjugated to match the second person plural subject, meaning "you (plural)." The past tense indicates that the action of going out or exiting has already happened.

Description: "יצאתם" is used to describe the action of a group of people going out or exiting from a place. It can be used in various contexts, such as asking a group of people if they have left a location or stating that they have already left.
