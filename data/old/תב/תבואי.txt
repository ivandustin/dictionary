Etymology: The word "תבואי" (pronounced "tavui") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בוא (bo), which means "to come" or "to arrive". The prefix ת (ta) indicates the future tense, so "תבואי" can be translated as "you will come" or "you will arrive".

Grammar: "תבואי" is the second person singular feminine form of the future tense verb "לבוא" (lavo), which means "to come" or "to arrive". In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the gender, number, and person of the subject. The suffix י (i) indicates the second person singular feminine form.
