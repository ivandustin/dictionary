Etymology: The word "וישבני" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "שב" (shin-bet), which means "to sit" or "to dwell". The prefix "ו" (vav) in Hebrew often indicates the past tense, so "וישבני" can be translated as "he sat me" or "he made me dwell".

Grammar: "וישבני" is a verb in the third person masculine singular form. The prefix "ו" (vav) indicates the past tense, and the root word "שב" (shin-bet) means "to sit" or "to dwell". The suffix "ני" (nun-yod) indicates the first person singular object pronoun, so the word can be translated as "he sat me" or "he made me dwell".
