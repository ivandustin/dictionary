Etymology: The word "וישתרו" (pronounced "vayishteru") is a Hebrew verb in the past tense. It is derived from the root ש-ת-ר (sh-t-r), which means "to deviate" or "to turn aside."

Grammar: "וישתרו" is the third person plural form of the verb, which indicates that a group of people performed the action. The prefix "ו" (vav) at the beginning of the word is the conjunction "and" in Hebrew. The root letters "ש-ת-ר" are followed by the vowel pattern "וּ" (u), which is used for the past tense in this case. The suffix "ו" (vav) at the end of the word indicates the third person plural.

Description: The word "וישתרו" is found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and is translated as "they turned aside" or "they deviated." It is used to describe a group of people who veered off course or departed from the expected path or behavior.
