Etymology: The word "ויקראה" (pronounced "vayikra'ah" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root קרא (k-r-'), which means "to call" or "to proclaim." The prefix ו (vav) means "and," and the suffix ה (he) indicates the feminine form of the verb. Therefore, "ויקראה" can be translated as "and she called" or "and she proclaimed."

Grammar: "ויקראה" is a verb form in the Hebrew language known as the "vav-consecutive" form. This form is used to indicate a sequence of events in narrative texts. The prefix ו (vav) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that it is in the past tense and that it follows a previous action.

Description: "ויקראה" is the third-person singular feminine form of the verb "to call" in Hebrew. It appears in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in the book of Leviticus (Vayikra in Hebrew), specifically in the first verse. The word is used to introduce the book and means "and she called" or "and she proclaimed." It refers to God calling Moses to speak to him from the Tabernacle.
