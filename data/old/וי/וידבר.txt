Etymology: The word "וידבר" (pronounced "vayidaber") is a Hebrew verb that comes from the root דבר (pronounced "davar"), which means "to speak" or "to say." The prefix ו (pronounced "vav") is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וידבר" can be translated as "and he spoke" or "and he said."

Grammar: "וידבר" is a third-person singular masculine verb in the past tense. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the gender, number, and tense of the subject. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix י (yod) indicates the third-person singular masculine form.

Description: "וידבר" is a verb that is commonly used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to describe various instances of speaking or saying. It is often used to introduce direct speech or to indicate that someone communicated a message or command. The word can be found in many biblical stories and passages, such as the story of Moses and the burning bush in Exodus 3:4: "וַיְדַבֵּר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו מֹשֶׁה הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי" (And God called to Moses and said to him, "Here I am").
