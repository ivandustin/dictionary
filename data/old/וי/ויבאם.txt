The prefix "ו" (pronounced "v") is a conjunction that means "and." The suffix "ם" (pronounced "am") is a third-person plural pronoun that means "them." Therefore, "ויבאם" can be translated as "and they came" or "and they arrived."

The prefix "ו" (vav) at the beginning of the word serves as a conjunction and connects the verb to the previous clause or sentence. The suffix "ם" (mem) indicates that the action is performed by a third-person plural subject.
