Etymology: The word "ויתנדבו" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root נ.ד.ב (n.d.b), which means "to volunteer" or "to offer willingly." The prefix ו (vav) in front of the root is a conjunction that means "and." So, ויתנדבו (vayitnadavu) is the third person plural form of the verb, meaning "and they volunteered" or "and they offered willingly."

Grammar: ויתנדבו (vayitnadavu) is a verb in the past tense, third person plural form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject and tense. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix ו (vav) indicates the third person plural subject. The root נ.ד.ב (n.d.b) remains unchanged.
