Etymology: The word "וישנס" (pronounced "vayishanes") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root י-ש-נ (y-sh-n), which means "to sleep" or "to rest." The prefix ו (vav) is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וישנס" can be translated as "and he rested" or "and he slept."

Grammar: "וישנס" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject and tense. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix ס (samech) indicates the third person singular form.

Description: "וישנס" is a biblical Hebrew word that appears in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 2:2. It is part of the creation story, describing how God rested on the seventh day after creating the world.
