Etymology: The word "ויבאום" (pronounced "vayavo'em") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root verb "בוא" (pronounced "bo"), which means "to come" or "to arrive." The prefix "ו" (pronounced "v") is a conjunction that means "and." The suffix "ם" (pronounced "em") is a third-person plural pronoun that means "them." Therefore, "ויבאום" can be translated as "and they came" or "and they arrived."

Grammar: "ויבאום" is a verb form in the Hebrew language known as the "vav consecutive" or "vav ha-hipuch." It is used to indicate a sequence of actions or events in narrative texts. The prefix "ו" (vav) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate the past tense, and the following verb is conjugated in the third-person plural form to match the subject of the sentence.

Description: "ויבאום" is commonly found in biblical texts, particularly in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It is used to describe the action of a group of people coming or arriving at a certain place. The specific context and surrounding words determine the exact meaning and significance of the word in each instance.
