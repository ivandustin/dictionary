Etymology: The word "ויבמה" (vivmeh) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root במה (b-m-h), which means "to marry" or "to take as a wife." The prefix ו (vav) in Hebrew often indicates the conjunction "and," so "ויבמה" can be translated as "and she shall be taken as a wife."

Grammar: "ויבמה" is a noun in the feminine form. It is derived from the verb "יבם" (yavam), which means "to perform the levirate marriage." In Hebrew grammar, nouns are inflected for gender, number, and case. The word "ויבמה" is in the singular form and is used to refer to a specific woman who is being taken as a wife through the levirate marriage.

Description: In Jewish law, the levirate marriage is a practice where a man is obligated to marry his deceased brother's widow if the brother died without leaving any children. The purpose of this practice is to ensure that the deceased brother's name and lineage continue. The woman who is taken as a wife through this practice is called "ויבמה" (vivmeh).
