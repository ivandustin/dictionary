Etymology: The word "ויקב" (pronounced "vayikav" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root י-ק-ב (yod-kuf-bet), which means "to gather" or "to collect."

Grammar: "ויקב" is a verb in the Hebrew language, specifically in the past tense form. It is conjugated in the third person singular masculine form. The prefix "ו" (vav) indicates the past tense, and the root letters "י-ק-ב" (yod-kuf-bet) form the base of the verb.

Description: The word "ויקב" is found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in the book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 49:10. It is part of a prophecy given by Jacob (Israel) to his son Judah, foretelling the future leadership and authority that will come from the tribe of Judah. The phrase in which "ויקב" appears is translated as "until Shiloh comes," and it is interpreted as a reference to the Messiah or a future ruler.
