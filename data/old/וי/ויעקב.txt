Etymology: The word "ויעקב" (pronounced "V'Yaakov" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root עקב (ayin-kuf-bet), which means "heel" or "to follow closely." It is believed to be derived from the story in the Bible where Jacob was born holding onto his twin brother Esau's heel.

Grammar: "ויעקב" is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: the prefix "ו" (vav), which means "and"; the root עקב (ayin-kuf-bet), which means "heel"; and the suffix "ב" (bet), which is a possessive pronoun meaning "his." Together, they form the word "ויעקב," which means "and his heel" or "and he followed closely."

Description: "ויעקב" is the Hebrew name for Jacob, one of the patriarchs of the Israelite people in the Bible. Jacob is known for his role in the story of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and for his wrestling match with an angel. The name "ויעקב" is often used to refer to Jacob in biblical texts and is still a common Hebrew name today.
