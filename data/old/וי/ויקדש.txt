Etymology: The word "ויקדש" (pronounced "vayikadesh") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root קדש (k-d-sh), which means "to be holy" or "to sanctify." The prefix ו (vav) in front of the root is a conjunction that means "and" or "he." Therefore, "ויקדש" can be translated as "and he sanctified" or "he sanctified."

Grammar: "ויקדש" is a verb in the Hebrew language, specifically in the past tense. It is conjugated in the third person singular masculine form. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix י (yod) indicates the third person singular masculine form. The root קדש (k-d-sh) remains unchanged.

Description: The word "ויקדש" is commonly found in religious texts, particularly in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It is often used to describe an action performed by God, indicating that He sanctified or made something holy. The specific context in which the word is used can vary, but it generally signifies the act of setting apart or consecrating something for a sacred purpose.
