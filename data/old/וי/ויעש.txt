Etymology: The word "ויעש" (pronounced "vay'as") is a Hebrew verb that comes from the root עשה (pronounced "asah"), which means "to do" or "to make." The prefix ו (pronounced "vav") is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "ויעש" can be translated as "and he did" or "and he made."

Grammar: "ויעש" is a verb in the past tense, third person, singular form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject, tense, and gender. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix י (yod) indicates the third person, singular form. The root עשה (asah) remains unchanged.

Description: "ויעש" is commonly used in biblical Hebrew to describe actions performed by a male subject. It is often translated as "he did" or "he made" in English. The specific meaning of the verb depends on the context in which it is used.
