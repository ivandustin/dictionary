Etymology: The word "וירבעם" (pronounced "Viyaravam" in Hebrew) is a Hebrew name that is composed of two parts. The first part, "וי" (pronounced "vi"), is a prefix that means "and" or "he." The second part, "רבעם" (pronounced "yaravam"), is a combination of two Hebrew words: "רב" (pronounced "rav"), which means "great" or "many," and "עם" (pronounced "am"), which means "people" or "nation." Therefore, the name "וירבעם" can be translated as "and he increased the people" or "he made the people great."

Grammar: "וירבעם" is a proper noun in Hebrew, specifically a masculine name. It is formed by combining the prefix "וי" with the word "רבעם." In Hebrew grammar, proper nouns do not have a specific grammatical gender or number.

Description: "וירבעם" is a biblical name that refers to a king of the northern kingdom of Israel. He ruled during the 10th century BCE and is known for leading the kingdom into idolatry and causing a division between the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel.
