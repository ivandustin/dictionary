Etymology: The word "ויברכה" (vibracha) is a Hebrew word derived from the root ברך (barach), which means "to bless" or "to kneel." The prefix ו (vav) in Hebrew often indicates "and," so "ויברכה" can be translated as "and she blessed."

Grammar: "ויברכה" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the past tense, third person, singular, feminine form. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root ברך (barach) means "to bless." The suffix ה (he) indicates the feminine gender.

Description: "ויברכה" is a word used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and is found in the book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 24:60. It is part of a blessing given by Rebecca's family to her before she leaves to marry Isaac. The full verse is: "וַיְבָרְכוּ אֶת-רִבְקָה, וַיֹּאמְרוּ לָהּ אֲחֹתֵנוּ, אַתְּ הֲיִי לְאַלְפֵי רְבָבָה; וְיִירַשׁ זַרְעֵךְ, אֵת שַׁעַר שֹׂנְאָיו." This translates to: "And they blessed Rebecca and said to her, 'Our sister, may you become thousands of myriads, and may your offspring inherit the gate of its enemies.'"
