Etymology: The word "ויזרעאל" (pronounced "Vizre'el" in Hebrew) is a combination of two Hebrew words: "וַיִּזְרַע" (pronounced "vayizra") meaning "and he sowed" and "אֵל" (pronounced "el") meaning "God." Therefore, the etymology of "ויזרעאל" can be understood as "and he sowed God" or "God sows."

Grammar: "ויזרעאל" is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: the prefix "וַיִּ" (pronounced "vayi") which means "and he," the root "זְרַע" (pronounced "zera") which means "to sow," and the suffix "אֵל" (pronounced "el") which means "God." The prefix "וַיִּ" indicates the past tense and the third person singular masculine form. Therefore, "ויזרעאל" can be translated as "and he sowed God."
