Etymology: The word "ויהושפט" (pronounced "Viyehoshafat") is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. The first part, "וי" (pronounced "Vi"), is a conjunction meaning "and."

It is composed of two elements: "יהו" (pronounced "Yeho"), which is a shortened form of the divine name of God, and "שפט" (pronounced "shafat"), which means "to judge" or "to govern." Therefore, the name "ויהושפט" can be translated as "and God judges" or "and God governs."
