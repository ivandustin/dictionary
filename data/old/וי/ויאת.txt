Etymology: The word "ויאת" (pronounced "vayet") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root letters ו-א-ת (v-ay-t). It is a combination of the prefix ו (vav), which means "and," and the word את (et), which is a direct object marker in Hebrew.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, "ויאת" is a verb form known as the "vav-consecutive" or "vav-conversive." It is used to indicate a sequential or consecutive action in the past tense. The vav-consecutive form is created by adding the prefix ו (vav) to the beginning of a verb in the past tense.

Description: The word "ויאת" is not a standalone word with a specific meaning. It is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) as a grammatical construct to connect verbs and indicate a sequence of actions. It is commonly translated as "and he" or "and she" in English translations of the Bible.
