Etymology: The word "ויהוריב" (pronounced "Vayehoriv" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew Bible, specifically from the book of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 13:28). It is a combination of two Hebrew words: "וַיְהַרְס" (pronounced "vayeharos") meaning "and he destroyed" and "יָרִיב" (pronounced "yariv") meaning "he contended" or "he argued."

Grammar: "ויהוריב" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. It is conjugated from the root י-ר-ב (Y-R-B), which means "to contend" or "to argue." The prefix "וַיְ" (pronounced "vay") indicates the past tense and the prefix "הַ" (pronounced "ha") indicates the third person singular.

Description: The word "ויהוריב" is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe the actions of certain individuals who contended or argued against the laws and commandments of God. It signifies a rebellious or contentious behavior, often associated with disobedience or opposition to divine authority.
