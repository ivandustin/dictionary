It is a combination of two words: "וַיִּשְׁמַע" (pronounced "vayishma") meaning "and he heard" and "אֵל" (pronounced "el") meaning "God". Therefore, "וישמעאל" can be translated as "and he heard God" or "God has heard".

It is written in the form of a verb with a prefix "וַיִּ" (pronounced "vayi") which indicates the past tense and the third person singular masculine form. The root of the word is "שָׁמַע" (pronounced "shama") which means "to hear". The suffix "אֵל" (pronounced "el") is added to indicate the object of the verb, in this case, God.

Description: "וישמעאל" is the Hebrew name of Ishmael, a significant figure in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. He is considered to be the son of Abraham and Hagar, and the half-brother of Isaac. According to the biblical narrative, Ishmael was born when Abraham was 86 years old.
