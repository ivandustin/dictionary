Etymology: The word "ויקניעם" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root קנע (k.n.a), which means "to humble" or "to subdue." The prefix ו (vav) in Hebrew is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, ויקניעם can be translated as "and he humbled them."

Grammar: ויקניעם is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the past tense, third person, singular, and masculine. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root קנע (k.n.a) is conjugated in the past tense with the suffix יעם (ya'am), which indicates the direct object "them."

Description: ויקניעם is a word that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), specifically in the book of Judges (Judges 8:16). It describes an action performed by Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, who humbled or subdued the elders of the city of Succoth with thorns and briers.
