Etymology: The word "ויקל" (pronounced "vayikl") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק.ל.ל (k.l.l), which means "to be light" or "to be easy." The prefix "ו" (vav) in Hebrew often indicates the past tense, so "ויקל" can be translated as "he became light" or "he became easy."

Grammar: "ויקל" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject and tense of the sentence. The prefix "ו" (vav) indicates the past tense, and the root ק.ל.ל (k.l.l) is the core of the verb. The suffix "י" (yod) indicates the third person singular form.
