Etymology: The word "ויניחום" (pronounced "vinichum") is a Hebrew word. It is a combination of two words: "וַיִּנָּחֵם" (vayinachem) and "אותם" (otam). "וַיִּנָּחֵם" is the third person singular past tense of the Hebrew verb "נָחַם" (nacham), which means "to comfort" or "to console." "אותם" is a pronoun that means "them." Therefore, "ויניחום" can be translated as "he comforted them" or "he consoled them."

Grammar: "ויניחום" is a verb in the third person singular past tense form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject and tense. The prefix "וַיִּ" (vayi) indicates the past tense, and the suffix "ם" (m) indicates the third person singular masculine subject.

Description: "ויניחום" is a word that describes an action of comforting or consoling someone. It implies providing emotional support or solace to others in times of distress or sorrow.
