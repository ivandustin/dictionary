Etymology: The word "ויעידו" comes from the Hebrew language. It is a verb form derived from the root ע.ו.ד (Ayin-Vav-Dalet), which means "to testify" or "to bear witness."

Grammar: "ויעידו" is the third person plural past tense form of the verb ע.ו.ד (Ayin-Vav-Dalet). It is conjugated in the prefix-conjugation pattern, which is used for transitive verbs in Hebrew. The prefix ו־ (vav) indicates the third person plural, and the root ע.ו.ד (Ayin-Vav-Dalet) remains unchanged.

Description: "ויעידו" means "they testified" or "they bore witness" in Hebrew. It is used to describe an action performed by a group of people who provided testimony or evidence in a legal or formal context.
