Etymology: The word "וינחמו" (pronounced "vinachamu" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root נ.ח.מ (n.ch.m), which means "to comfort" or "to console". It is formed by adding the prefix ו (vav) to the root, which indicates the past tense and third person plural form.

Grammar: "וינחמו" is a verb in the past tense, third person plural form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to the subject and tense. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix ו (vav) indicates the third person plural form. The root נ.ח.מ (n.ch.m) remains unchanged.

Description: The word "וינחמו" is found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), specifically in the book of Isaiah (Isaiah 40:1). It is translated as "they were comforted" or "they were consoled". The context of this verse is a message of comfort and hope to the people of Israel.
