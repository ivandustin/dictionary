Etymology: The word "ויקהיל" (pronounced "vayakhel") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root קהל (k-h-l), which means "to gather" or "to assemble." The prefix ו (vav) means "and," so ויקהיל literally translates to "and he gathered."

Grammar: ויקהיל is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the binyan (verb structure) called "kal," which is the most basic and common verb structure in Hebrew.

Description: ויקהיל is the name of a Torah portion in the book of Exodus (Shemot) in the Hebrew Bible. It is also the Hebrew name for the 22nd weekly reading in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah readings. In this portion, Moses gathers the Israelites together to instruct them on the construction of the Tabernacle, a portable sanctuary for worship.
