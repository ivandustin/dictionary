Etymology: The word "וימלך" (pronounced "vayimlach" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root מ-ל-ך (m-l-k), which means "to reign" or "to rule." The prefix ו (vav) in front of the root is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וימלך" can be translated as "and he reigned" or "and he ruled."

Grammar: "וימלך" is a verb form in the Hebrew language known as the vav-consecutive form. This form is used to indicate a past tense action that follows a narrative sequence. It is commonly used in biblical texts to describe events that occurred in the past.
