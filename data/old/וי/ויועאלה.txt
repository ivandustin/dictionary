Etymology: The word "ויעאלה" (pronounced "viy'aela" in Hebrew) is a combination of two Hebrew words: "וַיֵּעָל" (pronounced "vay'yal") meaning "and he went up" and "אֵלָה" (pronounced "aela") meaning "these." 

Grammar: "ויעאלה" is a verb form in the Hebrew language, specifically the past tense of the verb "לעלות" (pronounced "la'alot") which means "to go up" or "to ascend." The prefix "וַיֵּעָל" indicates the third person singular masculine past tense, and the suffix "אֵלָה" is a pronoun meaning "these." Therefore, "ויעאלה" can be translated as "and he went up these" or "and he ascended these."
