Grammar: "ויעל" is a conjugated form of the verb עלה (alah), which means "to go up" or "to ascend". In this form, it is in the past tense, indicating that the action has already taken place. The prefix "ו" (vav) indicates the third person singular masculine subject, and the suffix "י" (yod) indicates the past tense.
