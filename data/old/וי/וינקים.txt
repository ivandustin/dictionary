Etymology: The word "וינקים" (vinkeem) is a Hebrew word derived from the root נ.ק.ה (n.k.h), which means "to nurse" or "to suckle." It is related to the word יֵנֵק (ye-nek), which means "suckling" or "infant."

Grammar: "וינקים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the root נ.ק.ה (n.k.h). The ו (vav) at the beginning of the word indicates the conjunction "and," which connects it to another noun or phrase.

Description: "וינקים" refers to infants or young children who are still nursing or being breastfed. It is commonly used to describe babies or toddlers who are in the early stages of development and rely on their mothers' milk for nourishment.
