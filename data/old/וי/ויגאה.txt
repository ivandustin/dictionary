Etymology: The word "ויגאה" (pronounced "vigah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root גאה (g.a.h), which means "to be proud" or "to exalt oneself." The prefix ו (vav) in Hebrew often indicates the conjunction "and," so "ויגאה" can be translated as "and he was proud" or "and he exalted himself."

Grammar: "ויגאה" is a verb in the past tense, third person masculine singular form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject's gender, number, and tense. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix ה (he) indicates the third person masculine singular form.

Description: The word "ויגאה" is used in biblical Hebrew to describe someone who is proud, arrogant, or haughty. It can refer to someone who boasts or exalts themselves above others. In some contexts, it can also imply rebellion against authority or a sense of superiority.
