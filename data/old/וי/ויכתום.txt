Etymology: The word "ויקתום" (pronounced "vikhtom") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק.ת.מ (k.t.m), which means "to close" or "to shut." The prefix ו (vav) in front of the root is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "ויקתום" can be translated as "and he closed" or "and he shut."

Grammar: "ויקתום" is a verb in the past tense, third person masculine singular form. It is conjugated from the root ק.ת.מ (k.t.m) with the addition of the prefix ו (vav) and the suffix ם (final mem), which indicates the third person masculine singular pronoun.

Description: "ויקתום" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and appears in various contexts. It is often used to describe the action of closing or shutting something, such as doors, gates, or windows. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe the act of sealing or concluding something.
