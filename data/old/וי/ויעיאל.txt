Etymology: The word "ויעיאל" (pronounced "viyael" in Hebrew) is a Hebrew name that is derived from the combination of two words: "וַיַּעַשׂ" (pronounced "vayasa") meaning "and he made" and "אֵל" (pronounced "el") meaning "God." Therefore, "ויעיאל" can be translated as "and he made God" or "he made God."

Grammar: "ויעיאל" is a proper noun in Hebrew and is used as a masculine name. It follows the pattern of "וַיַּעַשׂ" (vayasa) which is the third person singular past tense form of the verb "עָשָׂה" (asa) meaning "to make" or "to do," combined with the word "אֵל" (el) meaning "God."

Description: "ויעיאל" is a name that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 31:6) and is associated with a skilled craftsman named Bezalel. Bezalel was chosen by God to be the chief artisan in the construction of the Tabernacle, a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. The name "ויעיאל" signifies the divine inspiration and guidance that Bezalel received in his craftsmanship.
