Etymology: The word "ויחדיאל" is a Hebrew name that consists of two parts. The first part, "וי" (pronounced "vei"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "חדיאל" (pronounced "khadiel"), is a combination of two Hebrew words: "חד" (pronounced "khad"), meaning "one" or "unique," and "אל" (pronounced "el"), which is a shortened form of "אלוהים" (pronounced "elohim"), meaning "God." Therefore, "ויחדיאל" can be translated as "and God is one" or "and God is unique."

Grammar: "ויחדיאל" is a proper noun in Hebrew, specifically a masculine name. It is formed by combining the conjunction "וי" with the word "חדיאל." In Hebrew grammar, proper nouns are not subject to grammatical rules like regular nouns.
