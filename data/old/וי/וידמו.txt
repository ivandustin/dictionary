Etymology: The word "וידמו" (pronounced "vidmu") is a Hebrew verb that comes from the root דמה (pronounced "dama"), which means "to resemble" or "to be similar." The prefix ו (pronounced "vav") in front of the root indicates the past tense, so "וידמו" translates to "they resembled" or "they were similar."

Grammar: "וידמו" is the third person plural past tense form of the verb דמה. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject and tense of the sentence. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the suffix ו (vav) indicates the third person plural. The root דמה remains unchanged.
