Etymology: The word "וישוב" (pronounced "vayashuv" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root שוב (shuv), which means "to return" or "to go back". The prefix ו (vav) in this word indicates the past tense, so "וישוב" can be translated as "he returned" or "he went back".

Grammar: "וישוב" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to the subject and tense. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the past tense, and the root שוב (shuv) is conjugated to match the subject. In this case, the subject is masculine singular, hence the form "וישוב".

Description: "וישוב" is a Hebrew word that means "he returned" or "he went back". It is commonly used in biblical texts and can refer to physical or metaphorical returns. The word can also be used in a broader sense to indicate a change or reversal of a situation or condition.
