Grammar: "וישמה" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. It is used to describe an action that occurred in the past, specifically when someone (he) listened or heard something.

Description: "וישמה" is a word found in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), specifically in the book of Genesis (Bereshit) 3:8. It is part of the narrative describing the aftermath of Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. The verse reads: "וַיִּשְׁמְעוּ אֶת קוֹל יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים מִתְהַלֵּךְ בַּגָּן לְרוּחַ הַיּוֹם" (And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day).
