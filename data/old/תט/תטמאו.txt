Etymology: The word "טְטְאוֹ" (tet'eo) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ט.א.ו (t.a.v), which means "to spin" or "to twist."

Grammar: "טְטְאוֹ" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe a spinning top or a dreidel, which is a traditional Jewish toy.

Description: A "טְטְאוֹ" is a small four-sided spinning top with Hebrew letters on each side. It is commonly used during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, where it is played in a game with rules involving gambling with chocolate coins or other small items. The dreidel is spun and depending on which letter lands facing up, players either win or lose a portion of the pot.
