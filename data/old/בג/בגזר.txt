Etymology: The word "בגזר" (begzar) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root גזר (g-z-r), which means "to cut" or "to divide." In Hebrew grammar, the term "בגזר" refers to a specific grammatical form called the infinitive construct.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, the infinitive construct is a verbal form that expresses the idea of an action or state in an abstract or general sense. It is often used to express the purpose, result, or consequence of an action. The infinitive construct is formed by adding the prefix ב־ (b-) to the root of the verb.

Description: The infinitive construct is commonly used in Hebrew to form infinitive phrases, which function as nouns in a sentence. These phrases can serve as the subject or object of a verb, or they can be used in various other grammatical constructions. The infinitive construct is an important element of Hebrew syntax and is used in a wide range of contexts in both biblical and modern Hebrew.
