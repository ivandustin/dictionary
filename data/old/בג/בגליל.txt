Etymology: The word "בגליל" comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root letters ב-ג-ל, which means "to roll" or "to revolve." The addition of the suffix יל (-il) indicates a place or region, so "בגליל" can be translated as "in the Galilee."

Grammar: "בגליל" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (be) means "in" or "at," and "גליל" (Galilee) is the noun that indicates the specific region.
