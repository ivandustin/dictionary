Etymology: The word "עמני" (pronounced "amni") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע-מ-נ, which means "to be with" or "to accompany." It is derived from the noun עם (am), meaning "people" or "nation."

Grammar: In Hebrew, עמני is a masculine singular adjective. It is used to describe something or someone as "with me" or "accompanying me." It can also be used to refer to something or someone as "belonging to me" or "of mine."

Description: עמני is a word that expresses a sense of closeness, connection, or ownership. It can be used to indicate a personal relationship or possession. For example, if someone says "זה הספר שלי עמני" (ze ha-sefer sheli amni), it means "this is my book, mine." It can also be used in a broader sense to express a sense of unity or solidarity, such as in the phrase "עמנו אלוהים" (immanu elohim), which means "God is with us."
