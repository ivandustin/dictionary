Etymology: The word "ארמים" (Armeem) comes from the Hebrew root רמ"א (R.M.A), which means "to deceive" or "to trick." It is derived from the noun ארמון (armon), meaning "palace" or "mansion." The term originally referred to the people who lived in the region of Aram, which is present-day Syria.

Grammar: "ארמים" is the plural form of the noun "ארמי" (Armi), which means "Aramean" in Hebrew. In Hebrew grammar, nouns can have different forms depending on their number (singular or plural), gender (masculine or feminine), and case (nominative, accusative, or genitive).
