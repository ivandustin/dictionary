Etymology: The word "פנינים" (pronounced "panimim") is a Hebrew word that means "pearls" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root פנה (pronounced "panah"), which means "to turn" or "to face." The plural form "פנינים" is used to refer to multiple pearls.

Grammar: In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number. "פנינים" is a masculine plural noun. It is used to refer to more than one pearl. In Hebrew, the plural form of nouns is often formed by adding the suffix "-ים" to the singular form.

Description: Pearls are hard, lustrous objects that are produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusk. They are valued as gemstones and are often used in jewelry. Pearls are formed when an irritant, such as a grain of sand, enters the mollusk and the animal secretes layers of nacre around it. This process creates the smooth, shiny surface of the pearl. Pearls come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, and they have been treasured for their beauty and rarity throughout history.
