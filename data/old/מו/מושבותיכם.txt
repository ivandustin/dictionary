Etymology: The word "מושבותיך" (Moshavotayich) is a Hebrew word derived from the root שבע (sh-v-a), which means "to sit" or "to dwell". The word is formed by adding the suffix יך (-ayich) to the noun מושבות (moshavot), which means "settlements" or "dwellings". 

Grammar: "מושבותיך" is a plural possessive form in Hebrew. The word is composed of the root משבות (moshavot), which is a feminine noun in the plural form, and the suffix יך (-ayich), which indicates possession in the second person feminine singular. Therefore, the word can be translated as "your settlements" or "your dwellings" in English.

Description: "מושבותיך" refers to the settlements or dwellings that belong to the person being addressed. It can be used to describe the physical locations where someone resides or the places that they consider as their home.
