Etymology: The word "מושבתיהם" is a Hebrew word that combines the root "שבת" (shavat), meaning "to sit" or "to dwell," with the prefix "מו" (mo), which indicates possession or belonging. The suffix "יהם" (yehem) is a possessive suffix that means "their" or "belonging to them." Therefore, "מושבתיהם" can be translated as "their settlements" or "the places where they dwell."

Grammar: "מושבתיהם" is a plural noun in Hebrew. The root "שבת" is in the passive form, indicating that the action of sitting or dwelling is being done to the subject. The prefix "מו" indicates possession, and the suffix "יהם" indicates the plural possessive form.
