Etymology: The word "מוציאם" (pronounced "motzi'im") is derived from the Hebrew root יצא (pronounced "yatsa"), which means "to go out" or "to bring out". The word is formed by adding the prefix מ (pronounced "m") which indicates "from" or "out of", and the suffix ם (pronounced "im") which is a plural masculine ending.

Grammar: "מוציאם" is a Hebrew noun in the plural form. It is used to refer to a group of people who bring something out or take something out. In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, and the plural form is used to indicate more than one person or thing.

Description: The word "מוציאם" can be translated as "those who bring out" or "those who take out". It is often used in the context of religious rituals, specifically in Judaism, to refer to the person who recites the blessing and brings out the bread during the ritual of "מוציא לחם מן הארץ" (pronounced "motzi lechem min haaretz"), which is the blessing over bread.
