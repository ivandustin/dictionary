Description: "מושבים" (Moshavim) refers to a type of rural settlement in Israel. Moshavim are agricultural communities where the residents own and cultivate their own land. They are typically smaller than kibbutzim (collective communities) and have a more individualistic approach to land ownership and work. Moshavim were established in the early 20th century as part of the Zionist movement's efforts to settle the land of Israel. Today, there are various types of Moshavim, including Moshavim Shitufiim (cooperative Moshavim) and Moshavim Ezrachiyim (private Moshavim).
