Etymology: The word "מחלף" (makhlef) comes from the Hebrew root ח-ל-ף (kh-l-f), which means "to exchange" or "to replace".

Grammar: In Hebrew, "מחלף" is a noun that is used to describe a place or a structure where people or vehicles can change or switch from one route or direction to another. It is commonly used to refer to an interchange or an overpass in the context of transportation.

Description: A "מחלף" is a specific type of road junction that allows vehicles to change from one road or highway to another without having to stop or cross traffic. It is designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion by providing separate lanes and ramps for entering and exiting different roads. Interchanges can vary in size and complexity, ranging from simple diamond interchanges to complex cloverleaf or stack interchanges. They are typically found in urban areas or at major intersections where multiple roads or highways intersect.
