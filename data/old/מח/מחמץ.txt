Etymology: The word "מחמץ" comes from the Hebrew root ח.מ.ץ (ch.m.ts), which means "to ferment" or "to sour." It is derived from the noun חָמֵץ (chametz), which refers to leavened bread or any food product that contains leavening agents.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "מחמץ" is a noun that is used to describe any food product that has undergone fermentation or contains leavening agents. It is typically used in the context of the Jewish holiday of Passover, where the consumption of chametz is prohibited.

Description: "מחמץ" refers to any food product that has been fermented or contains leavening agents, such as yeast or baking powder. During the holiday of Passover, Jewish dietary laws prohibit the consumption of chametz, and it is customary to remove all chametz from the home before the holiday begins. This includes not only bread and other leavened products but also any food or drink that may have come into contact with chametz.
