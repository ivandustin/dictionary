Etymology: The word "מחטאתי" (pronounced "machtati") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ח.ט.א (chet-tet-aleph), which means "to sin" or "to transgress." The word is formed by adding the prefix מ (mem) to the root, which indicates the first person singular possessive form, meaning "my" or "mine."

Grammar: "מחטאתי" is a verb in the first person singular form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to the subject and tense. The root ח.ט.א is in the past tense, indicating that the action of sinning or transgressing has already occurred. The prefix מ indicates possession, so the word means "my sin" or "my transgression."

Description: The word "מחטאתי" is used to express personal responsibility for a sin or transgression. It implies a sense of ownership and acknowledgement of wrongdoing. It can be used in a religious or moral context to express remorse or seek forgiveness.
