Etymology: The word "אצלתי" (pronounced "atzlati") is a Hebrew word that means "at my place" or "at my home." It is derived from the Hebrew preposition "אצל" (pronounced "etzel"), which means "at" or "with," and the possessive pronoun "שלי" (pronounced "sheli"), which means "mine" or "my."

Grammar: "אצלתי" is a compound word made up of two parts: "אצל" and "שלי." The first part, "אצל," functions as a preposition and indicates location or possession. The second part, "שלי," is a possessive pronoun that means "mine" or "my." Together, they form the phrase "אצלתי," which translates to "at my place" or "at my home."

Description: "אצלתי" is commonly used in Hebrew to indicate that something is located or happening at the speaker's place or home. It can be used in various contexts, such as inviting someone over or referring to a specific event or activity taking place at the speaker's home.
