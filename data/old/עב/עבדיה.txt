Etymology: The word "עבדיה" (Abdiah) is of Hebrew origin. It is derived from the Hebrew root עבד (avad), which means "to serve" or "to worship," and the suffix יה (yah), which is a shortened form of the name of God, Yahweh. Therefore, the name Abdiah can be translated as "servant of Yahweh" or "worshipper of Yahweh."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "עבדיה" (Abdiah) is a masculine proper noun. It is formed by combining the root עבד (avad) with the suffix יה (yah), which is a common way to form names in Hebrew. The suffix יה (yah) is often used to refer to God or to express a connection to God.
