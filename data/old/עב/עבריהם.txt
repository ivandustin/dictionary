Etymology: The word "עברית" (pronounced "Ivrit") comes from the Hebrew root עבר (A-B-R), which means "to cross over" or "to pass through." It is derived from the ancient Hebrew term עברי (Ivri), which means "Hebrew" and refers to the people who crossed the Jordan River into the land of Canaan.

Grammar: "עברית" is the Hebrew word for the Hebrew language. It is a feminine noun and is used to refer to the language spoken by the Jewish people. In Hebrew grammar, nouns have gender, and adjectives and verbs must agree with the gender of the noun they modify or are associated with.
