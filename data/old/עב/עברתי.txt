Etymology: The word "עברתי" (pronounced "ivriti") comes from the Hebrew word "עברית" (pronounced "ivrit"), which means "Hebrew." It is derived from the root ע-ב-ר (Ayin-Bet-Resh), which means "to cross over" or "to pass through." This reflects the historical significance of the Hebrew language as a means of communication and cultural identity for the Jewish people.

Grammar: "עברתי" is the feminine form of the adjective "עברי" (pronounced "ivri"), which means "Hebrew" or "Jewish." In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Therefore, when referring to a feminine noun, the adjective takes the feminine form, which is "עברתי."

Description: "עברתי" is used to describe something that is related to or associated with the Hebrew language or Jewish culture. It can be used to describe a person, object, or concept. For example, "שפה עברתית" (pronounced "safa ivrit") means "Hebrew language," and "תרבות עברתית" (pronounced "tarbut ivrit") means "Hebrew culture."
