Etymology: The word "מַנְשֶׁה" (pronounced "men-sheh") is a Hebrew name that has biblical origins. It is derived from the Hebrew verb "נָשָׁה" (pronounced "na-sha"), which means "to forget." In the Bible, Manasseh was the name of the firstborn son of Joseph and Asenath, and he became one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Grammar: "מַנְשֶׁה" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is written with the Hebrew letters מ (mem), נ (nun), ש (shin), and ה (hey). The word does not have any specific grammatical inflections, such as gender or number markers.

Description: In addition to being a personal name, "מַנְשֶׁה" can also refer to the tribe of Manasseh or the territory allotted to this tribe in the land of Israel. The name is often associated with the idea of forgetting or letting go of the past, as it reflects the circumstances of Manasseh's birth and his father's desire to forget his troubles in Egypt.
