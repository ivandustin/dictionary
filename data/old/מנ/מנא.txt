Etymology: The word "מנא" (pronounced "mena") comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the Aramaic word "מְנֵא" (pronounced "mene"), which means "numbered" or "counted."

Grammar: "מנא" is a noun in Hebrew. It is in the singular form and is masculine. It can be used as a subject or an object in a sentence.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the Book of Daniel, the word "מנא" appears as part of the phrase "מְנֵא מְנֵא תְּקֵל וּפַרְסִין" (pronounced "mene mene tekel upharsin"). This phrase is written on the wall during the feast of Belshazzar, and it is interpreted by the prophet Daniel as a message of judgment and doom for the Babylonian kingdom.

Outside of its biblical context, the word "מנא" is not commonly used in modern Hebrew.
