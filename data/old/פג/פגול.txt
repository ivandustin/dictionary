Etymology: The word "פגול" (pronounced "piggul" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root פ-ג-ל (P-G-L), which means "to be repulsive" or "to be abhorrent." 

Grammar: In Hebrew, פגול is a noun that is used to describe a specific type of sacrificial offering in the context of Jewish religious rituals. It is also used as an adjective to describe something that is considered impure or unacceptable.

Description: In Jewish religious rituals, פגול refers to a specific type of sacrificial offering that has become invalid or unfit for consumption. This can occur if the offering was not properly prepared or if it was intended for an improper use. According to Jewish law, a פגול offering is not permitted to be eaten and must be disposed of in a specific manner. The concept of פגול is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Leviticus 7:18) and is further elaborated upon in Jewish legal texts.
