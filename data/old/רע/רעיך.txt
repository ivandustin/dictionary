Etymology: The word "רעידה" (ra'ida) comes from the Hebrew root רעד, which means "to shake" or "to tremble". It is derived from the noun רעדה (ra'ada), which means "tremor" or "earthquake".

Grammar: In Hebrew, רעידה is a feminine noun. It is usually used in the singular form, but can also be used in the plural form רעידות (ra'idot).

Description: רעידה refers to an earthquake, which is a sudden shaking or trembling of the ground caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. Earthquakes can vary in intensity and can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. They are often accompanied by aftershocks, which are smaller tremors that occur after the main earthquake.
