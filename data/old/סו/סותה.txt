Etymology: The word "סותה" (soteh) comes from the Hebrew root ס.ו.ת (s.w.t), which means "to stray" or "to deviate." It is derived from the noun סות (sot), which means "straying" or "deviation."

Grammar: סותה is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a woman suspected of adultery in the context of Jewish law. In the Torah, there is a specific ritual called the "Sotah ritual" that is performed to determine the innocence or guilt of a woman accused of adultery.

Description: In Jewish law, a סותה (soteh) is a woman who is suspected of being unfaithful to her husband. The suspicion arises when there are signs of inappropriate behavior or when the husband has warned her not to be alone with a certain man. If the husband has reasonable grounds for suspicion, he can bring his wife to the Temple in Jerusalem to undergo the Sotah ritual. This ritual involves the woman drinking a special concoction made from water mixed with dust from the Temple floor and ink from a parchment containing a specific passage from the Torah. If the woman is innocent, she will be blessed with fertility and a healthy pregnancy. However, if she is guilty, she will suffer physical consequences, such as bloating or even death. It is important to note that the Sotah ritual is no longer practiced today, as the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 CE.
