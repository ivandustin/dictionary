Description: The "בחשן" (b'choshen) was a sacred garment worn by the High Priest in ancient Israel. It was made of gold and adorned with twelve precious stones, each representing one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The breastplate was worn over the ephod, another priestly garment, and was used as a means of divination. Inside the breastplate were the Urim and Thummim, two objects that were used to seek guidance from God. The High Priest would consult the Urim and Thummim by asking questions, and the stones on the breastplate would light up to provide answers. The "בחשן" (b'choshen) was an important symbol of the High Priest's authority and connection to God.
