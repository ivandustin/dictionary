Etymology: The word "בְּחוּצוֹתִיהָ" is a Hebrew term that translates to "in her outskirts" or "in her fields." It is derived from the root word "חוּץ" (chutz), which means "outside" or "outskirts."

Grammar: "בְּחוּצוֹתִיהָ" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. It consists of the preposition "בְּ" (be), which means "in" or "at," and the noun "חוּצוֹתִיהָ" (chutzoteyha), which means "outskirts" or "fields." The suffix "-יהָ" (-eyha) indicates possession, so the phrase can be translated as "in her outskirts" or "in her fields."
