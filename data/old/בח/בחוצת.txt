Etymology: The word "בחוצת" (b'chutzat) is derived from the Hebrew root "ח.ו.צ" (ch.w.ts), which means "to go out" or "to exit". It is formed by adding the prefix "ב" (b), which means "in" or "at", to the root.

Grammar: "בחוצת" is a noun in the singular feminine form. It is used to describe a specific location or area outside of a particular place. In Hebrew, nouns are typically formed by adding a suffix to the root, and in this case, the suffix "-ת" (-at) is added to the root "ח.ו.צ" (ch.w.ts).

Description: "בחוצת" is often used to refer to the area outside of a city or town, or the outskirts of a specific location. It can also be used more broadly to describe any area outside of a particular place.
