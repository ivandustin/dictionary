Etymology: The word "בחטאתיך" (b'chata'atecha) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "חטא" (chata), which means "to sin" or "to miss the mark." The suffix "-תיך" ("-techa") indicates possession, so "בחטאתיך" literally means "in your sin" or "because of your sin."

Grammar: "בחטאתיך" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (b') means "in" or "because of," and "חטאתיך" is the possessive form of the noun "חטאה" (chata'ah), which means "sin." The suffix "-יך" ("-echa") indicates possession, specifically the second person singular possessive form, meaning "your."

Description: "בחטאתיך" is used in Hebrew to express the idea of someone being guilty or responsible for their own sin or wrongdoing. It can be translated as "because of your sin" or "in your sin." This phrase is often used in religious or moral contexts to emphasize personal accountability for one's actions.
