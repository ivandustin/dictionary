Etymology: The word "בחמתה" (b'chamatah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "חמה" (chamah), which means "heat" or "anger". The prefix "ב" (b) means "in" or "with". So, "בחמתה" can be translated as "in her anger" or "with her anger".

Grammar: "בחמתה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (b) means "in" or "with", and "חמתה" is the feminine form of the noun "חמה" (chamah), meaning "anger". The suffix "ה" (ah) indicates possession, so "חמתה" means "her anger".

Description: "בחמתה" is used to describe a situation or action that is done with or in the presence of anger. It can refer to someone acting out of anger or a situation that is characterized by anger.
