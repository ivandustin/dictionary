Etymology: The word "בחמץ" (b'chametz) is of Hebrew origin. It comes from the root letters ב-ח-מ-ץ, which means "to ferment" or "to leaven."

Grammar: "בחמץ" is a noun in Hebrew. It is a masculine singular word.

Description: In Jewish tradition, "בחמץ" refers to any food product that contains leavening agents, such as yeast or baking powder, and has been allowed to rise. During the holiday of Passover, it is forbidden to eat or possess any "בחמץ" products. This is because, according to Jewish law, leavened bread is not permitted during this time.
