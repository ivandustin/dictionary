Etymology: The word "בחבלי" (b'chavali) is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts. The first part, "בחבל" (b'chavel), means "with a rope" or "with a cord." The second part, "לי" (li), means "to me" or "for me." When combined, the phrase "בחבלי" (b'chavali) can be translated as "with a rope to me" or "with a cord for me."

Grammar: "בחבלי" (b'chavali) is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (b) means "in" or "with," and it is followed by the noun "חבל" (chavel), which means "rope" or "cord." The suffix "י" (i) indicates possession or belonging, so "בחבלי" (b'chavali) can be translated as "in my rope" or "with my cord."

Description: The phrase "בחבלי" (b'chavali) is often used figuratively in Hebrew to express frustration, annoyance, or exasperation. It can be translated as "Oh my goodness!" or "Oh my gosh!" in English. It is commonly used in informal conversations and is similar to expressions like "Oh my God!" or "Oh my goodness!" in English.
