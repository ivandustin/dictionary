Etymology: The word "חטאתו" (pronounced "chatato") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ח.ט.א (chet-tet-aleph), which means "to sin" or "to miss the mark." The suffix "ו" (vav) indicates the possessive form, so "חטאתו" means "his sin" or "his wrongdoing."

Grammar: "חטאתו" is a noun in the masculine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, and they can be singular or plural. The word "חטאתו" is singular and masculine, referring to the sin or wrongdoing of a male individual.

Description: "חטאתו" is a term used in Jewish religious contexts to refer to a specific type of sin offering. In the Hebrew Bible, there are different types of offerings that were prescribed for various sins or transgressions. The sin offering, or "חטאת" (chatat), was a ritual sacrifice that was performed to atone for unintentional sins or sins committed unknowingly. It was a way for individuals to seek forgiveness and restore their relationship with God.

In Jewish tradition, the concept of sin and atonement is significant, and the sin offering played a crucial role in the religious practices of ancient Israel. Today, while the Temple no longer stands and sacrifices are not performed, the concept of atonement and seeking forgiveness for sins remains an important aspect of Jewish religious observance.
