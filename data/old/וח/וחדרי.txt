Etymology: The word "וַחְדֵרִי" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root חדר (chadar), which means "room" or "chamber". The prefix וַ (va) means "and", so וַחְדֵרִי (vachderi) can be translated as "and my room".

Grammar: וַחְדֵרִי (vachderi) is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word וַ (va) is a conjunction that means "and", and חְדֵרִי (chderi) is the possessive form of the noun חֶדֶר (cheder), which means "room". The suffix י (i) indicates possession, so חְדֵרִי (chderi) means "my room".
