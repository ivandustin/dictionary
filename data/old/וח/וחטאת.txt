It is often translated as "sin offering" or "sin sacrifice" in English. In the context of Jewish religious practices, a "וַחְטָאת" was a prescribed ritual performed by the priests to seek forgiveness for unintentional sins or transgressions.

The purpose of the sin offering was to restore the relationship between the individual and God and to cleanse the community from impurity.
