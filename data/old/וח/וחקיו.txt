Etymology: The word "וַחֲקִיו" (pronounced "vah-ha-kee-o") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root חקה (ch.q.h), which means "to engrave" or "to inscribe." It is derived from the noun חָקִיק (cha-keek), which means "engraving" or "inscription."

Grammar: "וַחֲקִיו" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the imperfect tense and is conjugated in the third person singular masculine form. The prefix "וַ" (vah) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root חקה (ch.q.h) is followed by the vowel pattern "ֲיִיּוֹ" (a-yi-yo), which indicates the future tense.

Description: The word "וַחֲקִיו" is not commonly used in modern Hebrew. It appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in the book of Job 19:24, where Job expresses his desire for his words to be engraved or inscribed on a rock as a testimony of his faith. The word conveys the idea of permanence and significance, as if something is etched in stone.
