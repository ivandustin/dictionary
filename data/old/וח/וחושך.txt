The prefix וַ (va) indicates the conjunction "and," and the suffix תָּן (tan) is a second-person plural imperative form, meaning "you all hurry" or "you all hasten."

Grammar: "וַחוּשְׁתָּן" is a verb form in the second-person plural imperative tense. It is used to give a command or instruction to a group of people, telling them to hurry or hasten.

Description: The word "וַחוּשְׁתָּן" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Exodus (Exodus 12:11). It is part of the instructions given to the Israelites before the first Passover, where they were commanded to eat the Passover meal in haste, with their loins girded, sandals on their feet, and staff in hand, ready to leave Egypt. The word emphasizes the urgency and speed with which they were to eat the meal, as they were about to be liberated from slavery and embark on their journey to the Promised Land.
