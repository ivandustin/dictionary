Etymology: The word "וֹרָאִיה" (pronounced "vorai'ah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ראה (ra'ah), which means "to see" or "to perceive." The prefix וֹ (vav) indicates the third person masculine singular possessive form, so the word can be translated as "his seeing" or "his perception."

Grammar: In Hebrew, וֹרָאִיה is a noun that functions as a possessive construct. It is formed by adding the possessive suffix יָה (yah) to the root ראה (ra'ah). The possessive construct is used to indicate possession or association, similar to the English possessive form with an apostrophe-s ('s).

Description: וֹרָאִיה can be translated as "his seeing" or "his perception." It refers to the act of seeing or perceiving something. The possessive form indicates that the seeing or perception belongs to a male third person.
