Etymology: The word "וֹרָאִי" (pronounced "vorai") is a Hebrew word that means "my teacher" or "my master." It is derived from the root word "ראה" (pronounced "ra'ah"), which means "to see" or "to perceive."

Grammar: "וֹרָאִי" is a possessive noun in Hebrew, formed by adding the possessive suffix "-י" (pronounced "-ai") to the root word "ראה." The possessive suffix indicates ownership or possession, so "וֹרָאִי" translates to "my teacher" or "my master."
