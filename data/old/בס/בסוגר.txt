Etymology: The word "בסוגר" (pronounced "basoger") is a Hebrew word that literally means "in parentheses." It is derived from the Hebrew root ס.ג.ר (s.g.r), which means "to close" or "to enclose."

Grammar: "בסוגר" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. It is composed of the preposition "ב" (pronounced "be"), meaning "in," and the noun "סוגר" (pronounced "soger"), meaning "parentheses." Together, they form the phrase "בסוגר," which means "in parentheses."

Description: "בסוגר" is used in Hebrew to indicate that a certain phrase or information is enclosed within parentheses. It is commonly used in writing, especially in formal or technical texts, to provide additional or explanatory information that is not essential to the main sentence. The phrase or information enclosed in parentheses is often set apart from the rest of the sentence and can be skipped without affecting the overall meaning.
