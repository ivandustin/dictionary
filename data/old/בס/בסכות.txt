Description: In Jewish tradition, "בַּסְכוּת" refers to a temporary booth or hut that is constructed during the festival of Sukkot. It is a symbolic structure that commemorates the temporary dwellings used by the Israelites during their journey in the desert after the exodus from Egypt. The sukkah is typically made of natural materials such as branches, leaves, and bamboo, and it is meant to be a reminder of the impermanence of material possessions and the reliance on God's protection.
