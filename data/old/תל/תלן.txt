Etymology: The word "טלן" (pronounced "taln") is a Hebrew word that means "dew". It is derived from the Hebrew root ט.ל.נ (T.L.N), which refers to the concept of moisture or wetness.

Grammar: "טלן" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe the small droplets of water that form on surfaces during the night or early morning. It is typically used in the singular form, but can also be used in the plural form "טלים" (talim).

Description: Dew is formed when the temperature of the air drops and reaches the dew point, causing water vapor in the air to condense into tiny droplets on surfaces such as grass, leaves, or windows. Dew is often associated with cool and calm weather conditions, and it plays an important role in providing moisture to plants and ecosystems. In Hebrew literature and poetry, dew is often used as a metaphor for freshness, purity, and renewal.
