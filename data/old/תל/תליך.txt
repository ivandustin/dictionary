Etymology: The word "טלית" (pronounced "talit") comes from the Hebrew root ט.ל.ה (T.L.H), which means "to cover" or "to wrap". It is derived from the Aramaic word "טלתא" (talta), meaning "cloak" or "shawl".

Grammar: In Hebrew, "טלית" is a masculine noun. It is usually used in the singular form, but can also be used in the plural form "טליתות" (talitot). It follows the pattern of nouns with the "י" sound in the middle, which is common in Hebrew.

Description: A "טלית" is a Jewish prayer shawl that is worn during morning prayers, on the Sabbath, and on holidays. It is a rectangular garment made of wool or other materials, with fringes (tzitzit) attached to its four corners. The "טלית" is draped over the shoulders and worn as a symbol of Jewish identity and devotion. It is often passed down from generation to generation and holds great significance in Jewish religious rituals and traditions.
