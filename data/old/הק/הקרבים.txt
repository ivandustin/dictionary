Etymology: The word "הקרבים" (HaKeravim) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק.ר.ב (k.r.b), which means "to come close" or "to approach." It is derived from the noun קָרֵב (karev), which means "nearness" or "closeness."

Grammar: "הקרבים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the root word קָרֵב (karev). The definite article "ה" (Ha) is added at the beginning to indicate that it refers to a specific group of things or people.

Description: "הקרבים" is often used to refer to the offerings brought to the Tabernacle or Temple in ancient Israel. These offerings were brought by the Israelites as a way to draw near to God and express their devotion. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of offering or sacrifice.
