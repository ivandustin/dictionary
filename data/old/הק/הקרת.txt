Grammar: "הקרת" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the feminine form and is used to refer to the act of reading or reciting.

Description: "הקרת" is a term that is commonly used in Jewish religious contexts to refer to the public reading of the Torah, the Jewish holy scripture. It is a central part of Jewish worship and is typically performed during synagogue services on Shabbat (the Sabbath) and holidays. The Torah is divided into weekly portions, and each week a different portion is read aloud to the congregation. The person who performs the reading is called a "קורא" (Koreh) or a "בעל קריאה" (Ba'al Koreh). The reading is done in a specific melody and is often accompanied by blessings and prayers. The purpose of the reading is to study and learn from the teachings of the Torah and to connect with Jewish tradition and history.
