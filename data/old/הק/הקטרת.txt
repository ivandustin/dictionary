Description: "הקטרת" is a term used in Jewish religious practices to refer to the incense offering that was burned in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. The ketoret was a mixture of various aromatic substances, including frankincense, myrrh, and other spices. It was burned on the golden altar inside the Holy of Holies, creating a fragrant smoke that was believed to be pleasing to God. The ketoret was offered twice daily, in the morning and in the evening, as part of the regular Temple service. It held great symbolic and spiritual significance in Jewish worship.
