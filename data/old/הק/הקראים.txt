Etymology: The word "הקראים" (HaKaraim) is derived from the Hebrew word "קרא" (kara), which means "to read" or "to call." The prefix "ה" (ha) means "the" in Hebrew, so "הקראים" can be translated as "the readers" or "the callers."

Grammar: "הקראים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ים" (-im) to the singular form of the word. The singular form of "הקראים" is "הקרא" (HaKara).

Description: The Karaites, also known as the Karaims or the Karaite Jews, are a Jewish religious movement that emerged in the 8th century CE. They reject the authority of the Talmud and other rabbinic writings, and instead focus on the Hebrew Bible as the sole source of religious law. The Karaites place a strong emphasis on individual interpretation and personal study of the scriptures. They have their own unique traditions and practices, separate from mainstream Judaism. The Karaites have historically been a small minority within the Jewish community, and today they are primarily found in Israel, the United States, and a few other countries.
