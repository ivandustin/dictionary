Etymology: The word "הקרחי" (pronounced "hakrachi") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק.ר.ח (k.r.ḥ), which means "to freeze" or "to cool." The prefix ה- (ha-) indicates "the," so הקרחי literally means "the freezing" or "the icy."

Grammar: הקרחי is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if used to describe a feminine noun, it would change to הקרחית (hakrachit) in the singular form.

Description: הקרחי is used to describe something that is icy or freezing. It can refer to the state of being frozen or the presence of ice. It is commonly used to describe cold weather, icy surfaces, or frozen objects.
