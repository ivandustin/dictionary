Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַהִיא" (ha'hi) comes from the root ה.ו.א (h.w.a), which means "to be" or "to exist." It is a demonstrative pronoun that is used to refer to something or someone that is distant in space or time.

Grammar: "הַהִיא" is a feminine singular form of the word, which means it is used to refer to a single feminine noun. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and the form of the word changes accordingly.

Description: "הַהִיא" is often translated as "that" or "those" in English. It is used to point to something or someone that has been mentioned before or is known to the speaker and the listener. It is commonly used in biblical texts and in modern Hebrew.
