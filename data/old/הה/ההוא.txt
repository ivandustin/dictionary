Etymology: The Hebrew word "ההוא" (pronounced "ha-hu") is derived from the root ה.ו.א (h.w.a), which means "to be" or "to exist". It is a demonstrative pronoun that is used to refer to something or someone that is distant in space or time.

Grammar: "ההוא" is a masculine singular form of the word, which means it is used to refer to a singular masculine noun. In Hebrew, nouns and pronouns have gender and number, and they must agree with the noun they are referring to.

Description: "ההוא" is often translated as "that" or "those" in English. It is used to point out or refer to something or someone that is not close to the speaker or the listener. It can be used to indicate distance in space or time. For example, "ההוא הוא הבית שלי" (ha-hu hu ha-bayit sheli) means "that is my house".
