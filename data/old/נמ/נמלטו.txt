Etymology: The word "נמלטו" (pronounced "niml'tu") is a Hebrew verb in the past tense, which means "they escaped" or "they fled." It is derived from the root נ-מ-ל-ט (N-M-L-T), which conveys the idea of escaping or running away.

Grammar: "נמלטו" is the third person plural form of the verb in the past tense. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to the subject and tense. The prefix "נ" (n) indicates the past tense, and the root "מ-ל-ט" (M-L-T) is the core of the verb. The suffix "ו" (u) indicates that the subject is plural.

Description: "נמלטו" is used to describe an action where a group of people or things escaped or fled from a certain situation or place. It implies that the subject successfully managed to get away from a dangerous or undesirable situation.
