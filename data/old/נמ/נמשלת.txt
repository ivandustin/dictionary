Etymology: The word "נמשלת" (pronounced "nimshelat") is a Hebrew word derived from the root "משל" (pronounced "mashal"), which means "to compare" or "to liken." The prefix "נ" (pronounced "n") indicates the passive form of the verb, so "נמשלת" can be translated as "is compared" or "is likened."

Grammar: "נמשלת" is the feminine singular form of the verb in the passive voice. In Hebrew, verbs can be conjugated to match the gender, number, and tense of the subject. In this case, "נמשלת" is used when referring to a singular feminine subject in the present tense.

Description: The word "נמשלת" is often used in Hebrew to describe something that is compared or likened to something else. It is commonly used in literature, poetry, and philosophical discussions to draw parallels or make analogies between different concepts or ideas.
