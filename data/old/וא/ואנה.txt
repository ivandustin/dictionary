Etymology: The word "וָאִינָה" (pronounced "vah-ee-nah") is a Hebrew word that means "and I am not." It is derived from the Hebrew verb אָנָה (anah), which means "to be" or "to exist," and the Hebrew conjunction וְ (ve), which means "and."

Grammar: "וָאִינָה" is a first-person singular present tense form of the verb אָנָה (anah), which is negated by the particle אֵין (ein) to express the negation "I am not." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and" and connects the negated verb to the subject.

Description: "וָאִינָה" is a phrase used in Hebrew to express negation in the first-person singular. It is commonly used to deny or negate a statement or claim.
