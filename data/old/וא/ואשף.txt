Grammar: "וֹאֵשֶׁת" is a compound word formed by combining the conjunction "וֹ" (meaning "and") with the noun "אִשָּׁה" (meaning "woman" or "wife"). In Hebrew, the word order is usually subject-verb-object, so "וֹאֵשֶׁת" can be translated as "and woman" or "and wife" depending on the context.

Description: "וֹאֵשֶׁת" is used in Hebrew to connect two nouns or noun phrases, indicating that both are present or involved in a certain situation or action. It is commonly used in biblical texts and can be found in various contexts, such as describing relationships, introducing characters, or indicating the presence of both a man and a woman.
