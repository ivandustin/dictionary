Etymology: The word "וָאֶלְמֵנָה" (pronounced "ve'elmena") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root א-ל-מ (aleph-lamed-mem), which means "to conceal" or "to hide." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix הָ (ha) is the definite article "the." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and the hidden one" or "and the concealed one."

Grammar: "וָאֶלְמֵנָה" is a noun in the feminine singular form. It is used to refer to a specific hidden or concealed entity.

Description: The word "וָאֶלְמֵנָה" is often used in Jewish mystical and Kabbalistic texts to refer to the hidden or concealed aspects of the divine.

In this context, it is often associated with the concept of the "Shekhinah," which is the divine presence or feminine aspect of God.
