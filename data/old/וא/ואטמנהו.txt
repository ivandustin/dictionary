Etymology: The word "וָאַתְמְנֵהוּ" is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "וָאַת" (va'at) meaning "and you" and "מְנֵהוּ" (menehu) meaning "counted him." 

Grammar: "וָאַתְמְנֵהוּ" is a verb phrase in the past tense, first person singular form. It is derived from the root word "מָנָה" (manah) which means "to count" and is conjugated with the prefix "וָ" (va-) to indicate the conjunction "and" and the pronoun "אַת" (at) meaning "you." The suffix "הוּ" (hu) indicates the direct object pronoun "him."

Description: The phrase "וָאַתְמְנֵהוּ" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Genesis (15:5). It is part of a conversation between God and Abraham, where God promises Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars. Abraham expresses doubt, and God tells him to look at the stars and count them if he can. The phrase "וָאַתְמְנֵהוּ" translates to "and I counted him" or "and I have counted him," indicating that God has already counted Abraham's descendants.
