Etymology: The word "וָאֶשְׁבָּה" (pronounced "va'eshbah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שבה (sh.b.h), which means "to sit" or "to dwell." The prefix וָ (va) means "and," and the suffix ה (ah) is a first-person singular pronoun, indicating "I." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and I sat" or "and I dwelled."

Grammar: "וָאֶשְׁבָּה" is a verb form in the past tense, first-person singular. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to the subject, tense, and gender. The prefix וָ (va) indicates the past tense, and the suffix ה (ah) indicates the first-person singular pronoun. The root שבה (sh.b.h) is conjugated in the past tense as אָשַׁבְתִּי (ashavti) for the second-person singular, אָשַׁבְתָּ (ashavta) for the second-person masculine singular, and אָשַׁבְתְּ (ashavt) for the second-person feminine singular.
