Etymology: The word "וָאַחְרֵב" (pronounced "va'ach'rev") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אָחַר (achar), which means "to delay" or "to tarry." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix בְּ (be) means "in" or "with." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and I delayed" or "and I tarried."

The prefix וְ (ve) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root אָחַר (achar) is conjugated in the past tense with the first person singular suffix תִּי (ti). The verb form indicates that the action of delaying or tarrying was performed by the speaker.
