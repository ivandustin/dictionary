Etymology: The word "וֹאַבְנָה" (pronounced "vo'avnah" in Hebrew) is derived from the root word "אבן" (pronounced "even"), which means "stone" in Hebrew. The prefix "וֹ" (pronounced "vo") is added to the root word to indicate the first person singular future tense. Therefore, "וֹאַבְנָה" translates to "I will build with stones" or "I will construct using stones."

Grammar: "וֹאַבְנָה" is a verb in the future tense, specifically the first person singular form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject and the tense of the sentence. The prefix "וֹ" indicates the first person singular, and the root word "אבן" is modified to fit the future tense.
