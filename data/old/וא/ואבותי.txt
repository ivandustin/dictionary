Etymology: The word "וָאִבּוֹתִי" (pronounced "va'ibboti") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אב (pronounced "av"), meaning "father." The prefix וָ (pronounced "va") means "and," and the suffix תִי (pronounced "ti") indicates the first person singular possessive form. Therefore, "וָאִבּוֹתִי" translates to "and my fathers" or "and my ancestors."

The prefix וָ (va) is a conjunction meaning "and," and אִבּוֹתִי (ibboti) is the noun form of the word "father" in the first person singular possessive form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, but "וָאִבּוֹתִי" is in the masculine singular form.
