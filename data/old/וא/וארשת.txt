Etymology: The word "וָאֵרֶץ" (pronounced "va'aretz") is a Hebrew word that means "and the land" or "and the earth." It is derived from the Hebrew root word "אָרַץ" (pronounced "aretz"), which means "land" or "earth."

Grammar: "וָאֵרֶץ" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and," and "אֵרֶץ" (pronounced "aretz") is the noun that means "land" or "earth." In Hebrew, nouns are usually placed before the verb, so "וָאֵרֶץ" is translated as "and the land" or "and the earth."

Description: "וָאֵרֶץ" is a common phrase used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to the physical world or the land of Israel. It is often used in conjunction with other nouns or verbs to describe specific locations or actions. The word can also have metaphorical or symbolic meanings, representing the earth as a whole or the land of Israel as a sacred place.
