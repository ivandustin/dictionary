Etymology: The word "וָאִידָן" (pronounced "va'idan") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ידן (y-d-n), which means "to judge" or "to rule." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," so the word וָאִידָן can be translated as "and I judged" or "and I ruled."

Grammar: וָאִידָן is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix וְ (vav) indicates the conjunction "and," and אִידָן (idan) is the root of the verb. The suffix וָ (va) indicates the first person singular pronoun "I."
