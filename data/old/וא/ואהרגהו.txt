"וָהֵרְגָה" is the third person singular feminine form of the verb "הָרַג" (harag), which means "to kill" or "to slay." "הוּ" is a pronoun that means "he" or "she." Therefore, the phrase "וָהֵרְגָהוּ" translates to "and she will kill him."

The root of the verb is "הָרַג" (harag), and the suffix "הוּ" (hu) indicates the third person singular masculine object pronoun "him."

Description: The phrase "וָהֵרְגָהוּ" is used in the Hebrew language to express the action of a female subject killing a male object. It can be found in various contexts, such as biblical texts or modern Hebrew literature, where it is used to describe acts of violence or aggression.
