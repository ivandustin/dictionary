Etymology: The word "וָאֵלְתְּקָה" (pronounced "ve'elt'kah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אלתק (alef-lamed-tet-kuf), which means "to bind" or "to tie." It is derived from the verb אָלַתְּקָה (alat'kah), which is in the past tense and means "I tied" or "I bound."

Grammar: "וָאֵלְתְּקָה" is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix וָ (va) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root אלתק (alef-lamed-tet-kuf) is conjugated in the past tense with the suffix ה (heh) to indicate the first person singular.

Description: The word "וָאֵלְתְּקָה" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in the book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 22:9. It is part of the story of the binding of Isaac, where Abraham is commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac. In this verse, Abraham says, "וַיָּבֹאוּ אֶל הַמָּקוֹם אֲשֶׁר אָמַר לוֹ הָאֱלֹהִים וַיִּבֶּן שָׁם אַבְרָהָם אֶת הַמִּזְבֵּחַ וַיַּעֲרֹךְ אֶת הָעֵצִים וַיַּעֲקֹד אֶת יִצְחָק בְּנוֹ וַיָּשֶׂם אֹתוֹ עַל הַמִּזְבֵּחַ מִמַּעַל לָעֵצִים" (vayavo'u el hamakom asher amar lo ha'elohim vayiven sham Avraham et hamizbe'ach vaya'arokh et ha'etzim vaya'akod et Yitzhak beno vayasem oto al hamizbe'ach mima'al la'etzim), which translates to "And they came to the place that God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and he bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood."
