Etymology: The word "וָאִילִי" (pronounced "vayili") is a Hebrew word that means "and to me" or "and mine." It is derived from the Hebrew root א.ל.ה (aleph-lamed-hei), which conveys the idea of possession or ownership.

Grammar: "וָאִילִי" is a combination of the Hebrew conjunction "וְ" (pronounced "ve") meaning "and" and the pronoun "אֲנִי" (pronounced "ani") meaning "I" or "me." The suffix "ִי" (pronounced "i") indicates possession or ownership.

Description: "וָאִילִי" is used in Hebrew to express possession or ownership. It is often used to indicate that something belongs to the speaker or is related to them in some way. For example, "זֶה הַסֵּפֶר שֶׁלִּי" (pronounced "zeh ha-sefer shel-i") means "this is my book."
