Etymology: The word "וָאֲבִימֶלֶךְ" (pronounced "va'avimelech" in Hebrew) is a combination of two words: "וָא" (pronounced "va") meaning "and I" or "and me," and "אֲבִימֶלֶךְ" (pronounced "avimelech") which is a proper noun meaning "my father is king" or "father of a king." 

Grammar: "וָאֲבִימֶלֶךְ" is a verb phrase in the past tense, first person singular form. The prefix "וָ" (va) is a conjunction meaning "and," and "אֲבִימֶלֶךְ" is the verb form of the proper noun "אֲבִימֶלֶךְ" (Avimelech). The verb form indicates that the speaker is performing the action of being Avimelech.

Description: "וָאֲבִימֶלֶךְ" is a biblical Hebrew phrase found in the book of Genesis (chapter 20, verse 2). It is spoken by Abraham when he introduces himself to Abimelech, the king of Gerar. The phrase can be translated as "and I, Avimelech" or "and me, Avimelech." It is used to identify Abraham as the same person as Avimelech, possibly to establish his authority or to gain favor with the king.
