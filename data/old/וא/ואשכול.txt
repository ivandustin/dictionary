Etymology: The word "וָאֶשְׁכֹּל" (pronounced "va'eshkol") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "שׁכל" (pronounced "shakal"), which means "to weigh" or "to consider." The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וָאֶשְׁכֹּל" can be translated as "and I considered" or "and I weighed."

Grammar: "וָאֶשְׁכֹּל" is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix "וָ" indicates the conjunction "and," and the root word "שׁכל" is conjugated in the past tense with the first person singular pronoun suffix "אֶ" (pronounced "e"). The verb form "וָאֶשְׁכֹּל" is used to express an action that was performed by the speaker in the past.

Description: "וָאֶשְׁכֹּל" is a word that is found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). It appears in the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 1, verse 24, where Moses recounts the story of the twelve spies who were sent to scout the land of Canaan. In this verse, Moses says, "וָאֶשְׁכֹּל בְּיַד־יְהוָה אֶת־הָאָרֶץ" (pronounced "va'eshkol be-yad Adonai et-ha'aretz"), which means "and I considered in the hand of the Lord the land." This phrase emphasizes Moses' trust in God's guidance and his acknowledgement that the land of Canaan was a gift from God.
