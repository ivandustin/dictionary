Etymology: The word "וָאִדְנִינוּ" (pronounced "va'adnenu") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וָ" (pronounced "va"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "אִדְנִינוּ" (pronounced "adnenu"), is a noun derived from the root word "אדון" (pronounced "adon"), which means "master" or "lord." Therefore, "וָאִדְנִינוּ" can be translated as "and our master" or "and our lord."

Grammar: "וָאִדְנִינוּ" is a combination of the conjunction "וָ" (and) and the noun "אִדְנִינוּ" (our master/lord). In Hebrew, the word order is generally subject-verb-object, but in this case, the word order is reversed for emphasis. The word "וָ" connects the previous clause or phrase to the noun "אִדְנִינוּ," indicating possession or association.

Description: "וָאִדְנִינוּ" is a term used in Hebrew to express a sense of ownership or affiliation. It is often used in religious or spiritual contexts to refer to God as the master or lord of a person or a group of people. It signifies a recognition of God's authority and sovereignty.
