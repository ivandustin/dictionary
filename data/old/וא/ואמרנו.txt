Etymology: The word "וָאַמְרָנוּ" (pronounced "va'amranu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אמר (amar), which means "to say" or "to speak." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix נוּ (nu) indicates the first person plural form of the verb. Therefore, "וָאַמְרָנוּ" translates to "and we said" or "and we spoke."

The prefix וְ (ve) indicates the conjunction "and," connecting the verb to a previous action or statement. The root אמר (amar) is conjugated in the past tense, and the suffix נוּ (nu) indicates the first person plural subject.
