Grammar: "וָאֶשְׁתָּה" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the first person singular future tense, indicating that the speaker (or writer) will perform the action of drinking. 

Description: "וָאֶשְׁתָּה" is derived from the root word "שָׁתָה" (pronounced "shatah"), which means "to drink". The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "vah") is added to the root to indicate the conjunction "and" before the verb. The suffix "אֶ" (pronounced "eh") is added to the root to indicate the first person singular future tense. Therefore, "וָאֶשְׁתָּה" translates to "and I will drink" in English.
