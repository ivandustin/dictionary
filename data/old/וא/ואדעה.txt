Description: "וָאַדְעָה" is a biblical Hebrew word that appears in the Book of Jeremiah 9:23. In this verse, the prophet Jeremiah says, "Thus says the Lord: Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me." The word emphasizes the importance of knowing and understanding God rather than relying on human wisdom, strength, or wealth.
