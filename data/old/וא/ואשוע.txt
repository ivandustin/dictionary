Etymology: The word "וָאֶשׁוּעַ" (pronounced "va'eshua") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "יָשַׁע" (pronounced "yasha"), which means "to save" or "to deliver." The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וָאֶשׁוּעַ" can be translated as "and I saved" or "and I delivered."
