Etymology: The word "וָאֶתְנַנָה" (pronounced "ve'etnanah") is a Hebrew word. It is a combination of the conjunction "וְ" (pronounced "ve") meaning "and" and the verb "אֶתְנַנָה" (pronounced "etnanah") meaning "I gave."

Grammar: "וָאֶתְנַנָה" is a first-person singular past tense verb form in Hebrew. It is derived from the root נ.ת.ן (pronounced "n.t.n") which means "to give." The prefix "וְ" indicates the conjunction "and," and the verb form "אֶתְנַנָה" indicates the action of giving performed by the speaker.

Description: "וָאֶתְנַנָה" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and is found in the Book of Numbers 32:33. It is part of a sentence that describes the land of Gilead being given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh.
