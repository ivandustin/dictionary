Etymology: The word "וַאֲנַקְמָה" (pronounced "va'anak'mah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root נקם (nakam), which means "to avenge" or "to take revenge." The prefix וַ (va) means "and," and the suffix ה (ah) is a feminine singular pronoun, which means "her." So, the word literally means "and I will avenge her."

The prefix וַ (va) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root נקם (nakam) is conjugated in the future tense with the first person singular pronoun אֲנִי (ani), meaning "I." The suffix ה (ah) is a direct object marker, indicating that the action of avenging is directed towards a feminine singular noun.
