Etymology: The word "וָאוֹתָם" (pronounced "va'otam") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וָ" (pronounced "va"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "אוֹתָם" (pronounced "otam"), is a pronoun meaning "them." 

Grammar: "וָאוֹתָם" is a combination of the conjunction "וָ" and the pronoun "אוֹתָם." It is used to connect two or more nouns or pronouns, indicating that they are all part of the same group or category. In Hebrew, the word order is usually subject-verb-object, so "וָאוֹתָם" is typically used after the verb to connect the object of the sentence.

Description: "וָאוֹתָם" is a versatile word that can be used in various contexts. It is commonly used in biblical and modern Hebrew texts to refer to a group of people or objects. For example, it can be used to indicate a group of individuals who have been previously mentioned or are known to the speaker. It can also be used to refer to a group of inanimate objects or abstract concepts.
