"וָאַמְלֵא" is the first person singular form of the verb "מָלֵא" (male), which means "to fill" or "to fulfill." "הוּ" is a pronoun that means "him" or "it." Therefore, "וָאַמְלְאָהוּ" can be translated as "I fulfilled him" or "I filled it."

The root of the verb is "מָלֵא" (male), and the suffix "הוּ" indicates the direct object pronoun "him" or "it."
