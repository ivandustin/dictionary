Etymology: The word "וָאַשְׁתְּמֵר" (pronounced "va'ashtemer") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שׁמר (sh-m-r), which means "to guard" or "to keep." The prefix וְ (v') means "and," and the prefix אַ (a') is a conjunction that means "that" or "so." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and I guarded" or "so I kept."

Grammar: "וָאַשְׁתְּמֵר" is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix וְ (v') indicates the past tense, and the prefix אַ (a') indicates the first person singular. The root שׁמר (sh-m-r) is in the Piel stem, which is an intensive form of the verb.

Description: "וָאַשְׁתְּמֵר" is a biblical Hebrew word that appears in the Book of Genesis, specifically in Genesis 3:6. It is part of the narrative of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where Eve is tempted by the serpent to eat from the forbidden tree. In this verse, Eve says, "וַתֵּרֶא הָאִשָּׁה כִּי טוֹב הָעֵץ לְמַאֲכָל וְכִי תַאֲוָה הוּא לָעֵינַיִם וְנֶחְמָד הָעֵץ לְהַשְׂכִּיל וַתִּקַּח מִפִּרְיוֹ וַתֹּאכַל וַתִּתֵּן גַּם לְאִישָׁהּ עִמָּהּ וַיֹּאכַל" (pronounced "va'tere ha'isha ki tov ha'etz lema'achal ve'ki ta'avah hu la'einayim venechmad ha'etz lehaskil va'tikach mipiryo va'tochal va'titen gam le'ishah imah va'yochal"). This verse translates to "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate." The word "וָאַשְׁתְּמֵר" is used here to describe Adam's action of eating the fruit after Eve gave it to him.
