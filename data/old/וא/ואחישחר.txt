Etymology: The word "וָאַחִישַׁר" (pronounced "va'achishar") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ח-ש-ר (ch-sh-r), which means "to bind" or "to tie." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the prefix אַ (aleph) is a conjunction that means "I." So, the word literally means "and I will bind" or "and I will tie."

Grammar: "וָאַחִישַׁר" is a verb in the first person singular form of the future tense. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject, tense, and gender. The prefix וְ (vav) indicates the future tense, and the prefix אַ (aleph) indicates the first person singular form. The root ח-ש-ר (ch-sh-r) remains unchanged.

Description: "וָאַחִישַׁר" is a biblical Hebrew word that appears in the Book of Genesis (Genesis 44:30).
