Etymology: The word "וָאֵרֵץ" (pronounced "va'aretz") is a Hebrew word that means "and the land." It is composed of two parts: "וָ" (pronounced "va"), which means "and," and "אֵרֵץ" (pronounced "aretz"), which means "land."

Grammar: "וָאֵרֵץ" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "וָ" is a conjunction that means "and," and "אֵרֵץ" is a noun that means "land." In Hebrew, nouns are usually placed before the verb, so "וָאֵרֵץ" is translated as "and the land."

Description: "וָאֵרֵץ" is a common phrase used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to the land of Israel or the Promised Land. It is often used in the context of God's promise to give the land of Israel to the Jewish people. The phrase can also be used more generally to refer to any land or territory.
