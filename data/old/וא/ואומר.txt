Etymology: The word "וָאוֹמֵר" (pronounced "va'omer") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אמר (amar), which means "to say" or "to speak." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," so וָאוֹמֵר can be translated as "and I said."

Grammar: וָאוֹמֵר is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. It is used when the speaker is referring to themselves and expressing an action they performed in the past. In this case, it means "and I said."

Description: וָאוֹמֵר is commonly used in Hebrew texts, including the Bible, to indicate that the speaker is recounting something they said in the past. It is often used to introduce direct speech or to report a conversation.
