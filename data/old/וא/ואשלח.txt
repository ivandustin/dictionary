Etymology: The word "וָאֶשְׁלַח" (pronounced "va'eshlach") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שָׁלַח (sh-l-ch), which means "to send." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the prefix אֶ (e) is the first person singular pronoun "I." Therefore, the word וָאֶשְׁלַח translates to "and I sent."

Grammar: וָאֶשְׁלַח is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. It is conjugated from the root שָׁלַח (sh-l-ch) by adding the prefix וְ (vav) and the pronoun אֶ (e). The verb form indicates that the action of sending was performed by the speaker in the past.
