Etymology: The word "וָאַחֵר" (pronounced "va'acher") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אַחַר (achar), which means "after" or "later." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," so וָאַחֵר literally translates to "and later" or "and after."

Grammar: וָאַחֵר is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the past tense and first person singular form. The prefix וְ (ve) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root אַחַר (achar) means "after." The suffix תִי (ti) indicates the first person singular past tense.

Description: וָאַחֵר is used in biblical Hebrew to express the idea of "and I afterward" or "and I later." It is often used to indicate a sequence of events, with the action described by וָאַחֵר occurring after another action.
