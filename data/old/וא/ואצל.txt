Etymology: The word "וָאֶצְל" (pronounced "va'etzl") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צ.ל.צ (ts.l.ts), which means "to reserve" or "to set aside." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the word אֶצְל (etzl) means "near" or "beside." Therefore, the literal translation of "וָאֶצְל" is "and near" or "and beside."

Grammar: "וָאֶצְל" is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix וְ (vav) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root צ.ל.צ (ts.l.ts) is conjugated in the past tense with the first person singular pronoun אֲנִי (ani), meaning "I." The suffix ל (l) indicates the direct object, which in this case is not specified.
