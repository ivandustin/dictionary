Etymology: The word "וָאֹדַע" (pronounced "va'oda") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ידע (yada), which means "to know" or "to understand." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," so וָאֹדַע can be translated as "and I knew" or "and I understood."

Grammar: וָאֹדַע is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix וְ (ve) indicates the conjunction "and," and אֹדַע (oda) is the root verb. The וָ (va) prefix is used to indicate the past tense, and the ע (ayin) at the end of the verb indicates the first person singular form.

Description: וָאֹדַע is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and is often translated as "and I knew" or "and I understood." It is used to express knowledge or understanding of something. The specific context in which it is used can vary, but it generally indicates a personal realization or awareness of a certain fact or situation.
