The prefix וְ (v') means "and," and the prefix אִ (i) is a first-person singular pronoun, so the word can be translated as "and I rested" or "and I settled."

Grammar: "וָאִנְחָה" is a verb form in the past tense, first-person singular. The prefix וְ (v') indicates the past tense, and the prefix אִ (i) indicates the first-person singular subject.
