Etymology: The word "וָאֶצוּעָה" (pronounced "va'etzu'ah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צעה (tsa'ah), which means "to wander" or "to roam." The prefix וָ (va) means "and," and the prefix אֶ (e) is a first-person singular pronoun, so the word can be translated as "and I wandered" or "and I roamed."

Grammar: "וָאֶצוּעָה" is a verb form in the past tense, first-person singular. The prefix וָ (va) indicates the conjunction "and," and the prefix אֶ (e) indicates the first-person singular pronoun "I." The root צעה (tsa'ah) is conjugated in the past tense with the suffix וּעָה (u'ah), which indicates the first-person singular subject.
