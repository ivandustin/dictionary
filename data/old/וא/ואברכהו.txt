Etymology: The word "וָאַבְרְכֵהוּ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "ברך" (barak), which means "to bless" or "to kneel." The prefix "וָ" (va) means "and," and the suffix "הוּ" (hu) is a third-person masculine singular pronoun, meaning "him." So, "וָאַבְרְכֵהוּ" can be translated as "and I blessed him."

Grammar: "וָאַבְרְכֵהוּ" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the past tense, first-person singular form. The prefix "וָ" (va) indicates the past tense, and the prefix "אַ" (a) indicates the first-person singular subject. The root word "ברך" (barak) is conjugated in the hif'il (causative) stem, which adds the causative meaning of "to bless."

Description: "וָאַבְרְכֵהוּ" is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 27:33). It is part of the story of Jacob and Esau, where Jacob deceives his father Isaac to receive his blessing. In this verse, Jacob says, "וָאַבְרְכֵהוּ גַּם בָּרוּךְ יִהְיֶה" (va'avrekhehu gam barukh yiheyeh), which means "I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed."
