Etymology: The word "וָאֵרָא" (pronounced "va'era") is a Hebrew word that comes from the Hebrew root א-ר-א (aleph-resh-aleph), which means "to see" or "to appear." It is derived from the verb רָאָה (ra'ah), which means "to see."

Grammar: "וָאֵרָא" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the first person singular, past tense, and perfect aspect. The prefix "וָ" (va-) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root "אֵרָא" (eira) means "I appeared" or "I was seen."

Description: "וָאֵרָא" is a word that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in the book of Exodus (Shemot) 6:3. It is part of the narrative of Moses and the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. In this verse, God tells Moses that He appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by the name of God Almighty (El Shaddai), but He did not reveal His name YHWH (often pronounced as Yahweh or Jehovah) to them. The word "וָאֵרָא" specifically refers to God's appearance to the patriarchs.
