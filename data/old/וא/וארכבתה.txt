Etymology: The word "וָאַרְכְּבֵהּ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root רכב (r-k-b), which means "to ride" or "to mount." The prefix וַ (va) means "and," and the suffix הּ (h) is a pronoun that means "her." So, the word can be translated as "and I rode her" or "and I mounted her."

Grammar: "וָאַרְכְּבֵהּ" is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. The prefix וַ (va) indicates the past tense, and the root רכב (r-k-b) is conjugated to match the subject, which is "I" in this case. The suffix הּ (h) is added to the verb to indicate the direct object, which is "her" in this case.
