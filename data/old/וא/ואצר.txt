Etymology: The word "וַאֲצַר" (pronounced "va'atzar") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צרר (ts-r-r), which means "to bind" or "to restrict." The prefix וַ (va) means "and," so the word וַאֲצַר can be translated as "and I will bind" or "and I will restrict."

Grammar: וַאֲצַר is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the future tense and is conjugated in the first person singular. The prefix וַ (va) indicates the future tense, and the root צרר (ts-r-r) is modified to fit the first person singular form.

Description: וַאֲצַר is used in various contexts in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It is often used to express the act of binding or restricting something or someone. The exact meaning and usage of וַאֲצַר can vary depending on the specific context in which it is used.
