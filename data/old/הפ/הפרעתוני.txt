The root פ-ר-ע (P-R-A) means "to disturb" or "to disrupt," and the suffix ת-ו-נ-י (-toni) indicates an adjective form. Therefore, "הפרעתוני" can be translated as "disturbing" or "disruptive."

Grammar: "הפרעתוני" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. For example, if you want to describe a feminine singular noun, you would use the form "הפרעתונית" (ha-pra'atonit).
