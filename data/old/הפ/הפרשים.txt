Etymology: The word "הפרשים" (HaParshim) is a Hebrew word that means "the portions" or "the sections." It is derived from the Hebrew root פ-ר-ש (P-R-Sh), which means "to separate" or "to divide."

Grammar: "הפרשים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to the weekly Torah portions that are read in synagogues on Shabbat (Sabbath) and during Jewish holidays. In Hebrew grammar, it is classified as a masculine noun.

Description: The Torah, the central religious text of Judaism, is divided into 54 portions, each called a "הפרשה" (HaParasha) in singular form or "הפרשים" (HaParshim) in plural form. Each week, a different portion is read, and the cycle starts again after the completion of the last portion. The portions are read in a specific order throughout the year, and they cover the entire content of the Torah, from the book of Genesis to the book of Deuteronomy. The reading of the weekly portion is an important ritual in Jewish religious practice and is often accompanied by commentary and discussion.
