Etymology: The word "הפילגשים" (HaPilgashim) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "פ.ל.ג.ש" (P.L.G.SH), which means "to divide" or "to separate." It is derived from the noun "פֶּלֶג" (peleg), which means "half" or "portion."

Grammar: "הפילגשים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ים" (-im) to the singular form "הפילגש" (HaPilgash). The word is used to refer to concubines or secondary wives in biblical times.

Description: In ancient Hebrew society, a "פילגש" (Pilgash) was a woman who was legally married to a man but held a lower status than a full wife. She was often acquired through purchase or as a gift. While she had certain rights and protections, she did not have the same status or privileges as a wife. The plural form "הפילגשים" (HaPilgashim) refers to multiple concubines or secondary wives.
