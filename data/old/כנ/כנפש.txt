Etymology: The word "כְּנַפְשֵׁךְ" (kenafshekh) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root נפשׁ (nafash), which means "soul" or "life." The prefix כְּ (ke-) indicates "like" or "as," so כְּנַפְשֵׁךְ can be translated as "like your soul" or "as your life."

Grammar: כְּנַפְשֵׁךְ is a noun phrase in the second person singular feminine form. The prefix כְּ (ke-) indicates the comparison, and נַפְשֵׁךְ (nafshekh) is the possessive form of נֶפֶשׁ (nefesh), meaning "your soul" or "your life."

Description: כְּנַפְשֵׁךְ is a phrase used in Hebrew to express a strong emphasis or oath. It is often translated as "I swear by your life" or "I swear on my life." It is a way of emphasizing the truthfulness or seriousness of a statement.
