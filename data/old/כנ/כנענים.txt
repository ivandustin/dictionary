Etymology: The word "כְּנָעַנִים" (pronounced "kə·nā·‘a·nîm") comes from the Hebrew root כּנע (k-n-‘), which means "to be low" or "to be humbled." It is derived from the ancient Canaanite people who inhabited the land of Canaan, which is present-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and parts of Jordan and Syria.

Grammar: "כְּנָעַנִים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the root word כְּנָעַן (kə·nā·‘an), which means "Canaan." The plural form indicates that it refers to multiple Canaanites.

Description: The word "כְּנָעַנִים" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the ancient Canaanite people who lived in the land of Canaan before the Israelites settled there. They were known for their advanced civilization, trade networks, and agricultural practices. The Canaanites had a significant influence on the culture and history of the region.
