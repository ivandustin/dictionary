Grammar: "כְּנֵהַּמֵּת" is a compound word formed by combining the preposition "כְּנֵהּ" (keneh) with the noun "מֵת" (met). In Hebrew, compound words are often formed by combining two or more words to create a new word with a different meaning.

Description: "כְּנֵהַּמֵּת" is a metaphorical phrase used in Hebrew to describe someone who is weak, fragile, or easily influenced. The comparison to a dead reed suggests a lack of strength or vitality. This phrase can be used to describe a person's physical or emotional state.
