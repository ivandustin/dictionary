Etymology: The word "כְּנֹפוֹת" (kenafot) is a Hebrew word derived from the root כּ.נ.פ (k.n.p), which means "to cover" or "to spread out." It is related to the word כָּנָף (kanaf), which means "wing" or "edge."

Grammar: כְּנֹפוֹת is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word כְּנֹפוֹת is feminine and plural.

Description: כְּנֹפוֹת refers to the wings or edges of a garment. In biblical and modern Hebrew, it is often used metaphorically to describe the corners or fringes of a garment, especially those that are required by Jewish law to be worn on a four-cornered garment, such as a tallit (prayer shawl). These fringes, known as tzitzit, serve as a reminder of the commandments and the wearer's connection to God.
