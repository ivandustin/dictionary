Etymology: The word "טנאך" (pronounced "tanakh") comes from the Hebrew acronym תנ"ך, which stands for תורה (Torah), נביאים (Nevi'im), and כתובים (Ketuvim). These three sections make up the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh.

Grammar: "טנאך" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to the Hebrew Bible as a whole. It is often translated as "the Bible" or "the Scriptures" in English.

Description: The Tanakh is the sacred text of Judaism and consists of the same books as the Old Testament in Christianity. It is divided into three main sections: the Torah, which contains the five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy); the Nevi'im, which includes the books of the prophets; and the Ketuvim, which contains various writings, including Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, among others. The Tanakh is considered the foundational text of Judaism and is studied and revered by Jewish communities worldwide.
