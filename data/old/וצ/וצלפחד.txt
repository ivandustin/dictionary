Etymology: The word "וּצְלָפְחַד" (utzlafchad) is a Hebrew name that appears in the Bible. It is composed of two elements: "וּ" (u), meaning "and," and "צְלָפְחַד" (tzlafchad), which is a combination of the words "צֶלֶף" (tzelaf), meaning "shadow" or "shade," and "חַד" (chad), meaning "one" or "only." Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "and the shadow of one" or "and the only shadow."

Grammar: "וּצְלָפְחַד" (utzlafchad) is a masculine proper noun in Hebrew. It is written with the conjunction "וּ" (u) at the beginning, which means "and" in English. The name is composed of two parts: "צְלָפְחַד" (tzlafchad), which is the main element, and the conjunction "וּ" (u) that connects it to another word or phrase.

Description: In the Bible, "וּצְלָפְחַד" (utzlafchad) is the name of a man from the tribe of Manasseh. He had five daughters and no sons, which raised a question regarding the inheritance of land. This led to a change in the inheritance laws, allowing daughters to inherit land if there were no male heirs. The story of "וּצְלָפְחַד" (utzlafchad) is found in the book of Numbers, chapter 27.
