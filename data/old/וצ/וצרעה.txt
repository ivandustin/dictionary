Etymology: The word "וּצְרֵעָה" (utzre'ah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צ-ר-ע (ts-r-a), which means "to be afflicted" or "to be struck with a skin disease." 

Grammar: "וּצְרֵעָה" is a noun in the feminine form. It is used to describe a specific skin disease known as "tzara'at" in Hebrew. In grammar, it is classified as a singular noun.

Description: "וּצְרֵעָה" refers to a skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Leviticus. It is commonly translated as "leprosy" in English, although it is not the same as the modern medical condition known as leprosy. Tzara'at was a condition that affected the skin, hair, and even clothing, and it was considered a spiritual affliction rather than a purely physical one. In biblical times, those who were afflicted with tzara'at were required to undergo a purification process and were isolated from the community until they were declared clean by a priest.
