Etymology: The word "וּצְדָקִיָּה" (pronounced "utzdakiya") is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. "וּצְדָק" (utzdak) means "and righteousness" in Hebrew, and "יָה" (yah) is a shortened form of the name of God in Hebrew. Therefore, the name "וּצְדָקִיָּה" can be translated as "and righteousness of God" or "God is my righteousness."

Grammar: "וּצְדָקִיָּה" is a masculine Hebrew name. It consists of six letters: ו (vav), צ (tsadi), ד (dalet), ק (kuf), י (yod), and ה (he). In Hebrew, names often have significant meanings and are used to convey a message or express a belief.

Description: "וּצְדָקִיָּה" is a biblical name that appears in the Old Testament.
