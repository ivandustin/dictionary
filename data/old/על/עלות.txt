Description: In Jewish tradition, "עָלוֹת" (alot) refers to the burnt offerings that were brought to the altar in the Temple as a form of worship and atonement. These offerings were completely consumed by fire, symbolizing the complete dedication and surrender to God. The עָלוֹת (alot) were typically made from animals, such as sheep, goats, or birds, and were offered by individuals or the community as a whole. The practice of offering עָלוֹת (alot) ceased with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.
