Grammar: "השן" (hashen) is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to a tooth or teeth. It can be used in both singular and plural forms, depending on the context.

Description: "השן" (hashen) is an important part of the human body and is used for biting, chewing, and grinding food. It is a hard, calcified structure that is embedded in the jawbone. Humans typically have two sets of teeth: the primary teeth, also known as baby teeth, and the permanent teeth. The primary teeth start to erupt around the age of six months and are eventually replaced by the permanent teeth. Good dental hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing, is essential for maintaining healthy teeth.
