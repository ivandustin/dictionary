Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשָּׁאֵלָה" (hash'elah) comes from the root שָׁאַל (sha'al), which means "to ask" or "to inquire." 

Grammar: "הַשָּׁאֵלָה" is a feminine noun in the singular form. It is preceded by the definite article "הַ" (ha), which means "the" in English. 

Description: "הַשָּׁאֵלָה" is translated as "the question" in English. It refers to an inquiry or a request for information or clarification. In Hebrew, questions are formed by placing the interrogative particle "הַאֵם" (ha'im) at the beginning of a sentence or by using question words such as "מָה" (mah) for "what," "אֵיפֹה" (eifo) for "where," or "מָתַי" (matay) for "when."
