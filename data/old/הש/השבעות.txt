Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשְׁבָּעוֹת" (hashavuot) comes from the root שׁבע (shava), which means "seven." It is derived from the fact that the holiday of Shavuot falls on the seventh week after Passover.

Grammar: "הַשְׁבָּעוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix וֹת (-ot) to the root word שָׁבוּעַ (shavua), which means "week." The definite article הַ (ha) is added at the beginning to indicate "the."

Description: Shavuot is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the giving of the Torah (the Jewish law) to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. It is celebrated on the sixth day of the Hebrew month of Sivan, which usually falls in late May or early June. Shavuot is also known as the Festival of Weeks, as it marks the completion of the seven-week counting period between Passover and Shavuot. It is a time of joy, gratitude, and study of the Torah. Traditional customs include staying up all night to study, eating dairy foods, and decorating homes and synagogues with flowers and greenery.
