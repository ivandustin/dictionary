Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשְׁמָאֵלִי" (HaShemaeli) is derived from the root word "שֵׁם" (shem), which means "name" in Hebrew. The suffix "-אֵלִי" (-aeli) is added to indicate possession or belonging. Therefore, "הַשְׁמָאֵלִי" can be translated as "belonging to Shem" or "of Shem."

Grammar: "הַשְׁמָאֵלִי" is a Hebrew adjective that is used to describe something or someone that belongs to or is associated with Shem. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, the form of the adjective may change depending on the gender and number of the noun it modifies.
