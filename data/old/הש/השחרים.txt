Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשְׁחָרִים" (hashacharim) comes from the root שׁ-ח-ר (sh-ch-r), which means "dawn" or "morning." It is derived from the noun שַׁחַר (shachar), which specifically refers to the time of day when the sky begins to lighten before sunrise.

Grammar: "הַשְׁחָרִים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the root word שַׁחַר (shachar). The definite article הַ (ha) is also added at the beginning of the word, indicating "the" in English.

Description: "הַשְׁחָרִים" refers to the morning hours or the time of day before sunrise. It is often used in Hebrew literature and prayers to symbolize the beginning of a new day or a fresh start. In Jewish tradition, the term is also associated with the daily morning prayers known as "Tefillat Hashachar" (Morning Prayer).
