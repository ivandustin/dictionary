Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשְׁמָאֵל" (HaShemael) is derived from the combination of two Hebrew words: "הַשֵּׁם" (HaShem), meaning "the name," and "אֵל" (El), meaning "God." Therefore, "הַשְׁמָאֵל" can be translated as "the name of God" or "God's name."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "הַשְׁמָאֵל" is a noun phrase consisting of the definite article "הַ" (Ha) and the noun "שֵּׁם" (Shem), meaning "name." The word "אֵל" (El) functions as an adjective modifying the noun "שֵּׁם" (Shem), indicating possession or association.

Description: "הַשְׁמָאֵל" is a term used in Jewish tradition to refer to the name of God. It is considered a sacred and holy name, and is often used as a substitute for directly pronouncing the Tetragrammaton (the four-letter name of God) out of reverence. The use of "הַשְׁמָאֵל" is common in prayers, blessings, and religious texts.
