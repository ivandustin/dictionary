Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשְׁמַטָּה" (hashmatá) comes from the root שׁ-מ-ט (sh-m-t), which means "to release" or "to let go." It is derived from the verb שָׁמַט (shamat), which means "to release" or "to let go."

Grammar: הַשְׁמַטָּה is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to describe the act of releasing or letting go, particularly in the context of canceling debts or freeing slaves. It can also refer to the sabbatical year, a year of rest and release for the land in the agricultural cycle.

Description: הַשְׁמַטָּה is a significant concept in Jewish law and tradition. It is the biblical commandment to release debts and free slaves every seven years, as prescribed in the Torah. This practice promotes social justice and economic equality by preventing the accumulation of wealth and ensuring the well-being of those in need. The sabbatical year, during which the land is left fallow, is also a part of the הַשְׁמַטָּה observance.
