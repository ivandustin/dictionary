Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשֵּׁם" (hashem) comes from the root שָׁמַם (shamam), which means "to be desolate" or "to be astonished." It is derived from the noun שֵׁם (shem), which means "name."

Grammar: הַשֵּׁם (hashem) is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is usually preceded by the definite article הַ (ha), which means "the." In Hebrew grammar, nouns can have different forms depending on their function in a sentence, such as subject, object, or possessive.

Description: הַשֵּׁם (hashem) is a term used in Judaism to refer to the name of God. It is considered a substitute for the actual name of God, which is considered too sacred to be pronounced. This practice is based on the commandment in the Hebrew Bible not to take the name of God in vain. Instead of pronouncing the name, Jews use various substitutes, such as הַשֵּׁם (hashem), אֲדֹנָי (Adonai), or הָאֱלֹהִים (Elohim), when reading or speaking about God.
