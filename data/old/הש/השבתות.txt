Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַשְׁבֵּתוֹת" (hashvētōt) is derived from the root שׁבת (shavat), which means "to rest" or "to cease." It is related to the Hebrew word "שַׁבָּת" (shabbat), which refers to the Jewish day of rest.

Grammar: "הַשְׁבֵּתוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix וֹת (-ot) to the root word שַׁבָּת (shabbat). The definite article הַ (ha) is added at the beginning to indicate "the."

Description: "הַשְׁבֵּתוֹת" is the Hebrew word for "the weeks." It is used to refer to a period of seven days, specifically in the context of counting the weeks between two events. In Jewish tradition, the counting of the weeks begins on the second day of Passover and ends on the holiday of Shavuot. This period is known as the "Counting of the Omer," and each day is counted using this word.
