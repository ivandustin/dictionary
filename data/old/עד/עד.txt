Etymology: The word "עד" (pronounced "ad" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root עדה, which means "to testify" or "to bear witness." It is related to the Aramaic word עדא (ada) and the Arabic word عَدَى (ʿada), both of which also mean "to testify."

Grammar: In Hebrew, עד is a preposition that means "until" or "up to." It is used to indicate a limit or endpoint in time or space. It can also be used as a conjunction to connect two clauses or phrases.

Description: עד is a versatile word that is commonly used in everyday Hebrew. It is used to express duration, such as "from Monday until Friday" (מיום שני עד יום שישי) or "from morning until evening" (מבוקר עד ערב).

Additionally, עד can be used to express a limit or boundary, such as "up to the age of 18" (עד גיל 18) or "up to the border" (עד הגבול).
