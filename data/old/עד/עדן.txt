Etymology: The word "עֵדֶן" (pronounced "eden") comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root ע־ד־נ (Ayin-Dalet-Nun), which means "delight" or "pleasure."

Grammar: In Hebrew, עֵדֶן is a noun that is commonly used to refer to the Garden of Eden, the paradise described in the Bible. It is also used metaphorically to describe a place of beauty, happiness, or perfection.

Description: עֵדֶן is a concept that holds significant religious and cultural importance in Judaism and Christianity. In the Bible, the Garden of Eden is depicted as a lush and idyllic place where the first human beings, Adam and Eve, lived in harmony with nature and with God.
