Etymology: The word "כילדה" (kiladah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כ.ל.ד (k.l.d), which means "to be born" or "to give birth." It is derived from the noun יֶלֶד (yeled), which means "child" or "offspring."

Grammar: "כילדה" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to describe a specific type of birthmark or mole that appears on the skin. In Hebrew grammar, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also be declined for case (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.) and state (definite or indefinite).

Description: "כילדה" refers to a birthmark or mole that is present on the skin from birth. It can vary in size, shape, and color. Birthmarks are generally harmless and can appear anywhere on the body. They can be flat or raised, and their appearance can change over time. Some birthmarks may fade or disappear as a person grows older, while others may remain throughout their life.
