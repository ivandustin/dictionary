Etymology: The word "כִּיוֹלְדָה" (kiyoldah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ילד (yalad), which means "to give birth" or "to beget." The prefix כִּי (ki) is a conjunction that means "because" or "for." Therefore, כִּיוֹלְדָה can be translated as "because of childbirth" or "for the sake of giving birth."

Grammar: כִּיוֹלְדָה is a feminine noun in the singular form. It is derived from the verb ילד (yalad), which is in the past tense. The prefix כִּי (ki) indicates a cause or reason, and the suffix ה (ah) denotes the feminine gender.

Description: כִּיוֹלְדָה is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a woman's postpartum period. It is the period of time after childbirth during which certain laws and restrictions apply to the mother. These laws include ritual impurity, abstaining from sexual relations, and other practices aimed at ensuring the well-being of the mother and the newborn. The duration of כִּיוֹלְדָה varies depending on the sex of the child and other factors.
