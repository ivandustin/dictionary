Description: A מגפן (migfen) is a woody, climbing plant that belongs to the Vitaceae family. It is cultivated for its fruit, which are grapes. Grapevines are known for their long, twisting stems and tendrils that allow them to climb and cling to structures or other plants for support. They have large, green leaves and produce clusters of small, round or oval-shaped fruits that can vary in color, including green, red, or purple. Grapevines are widely grown in vineyards for the production of wine, as well as for eating fresh or dried as raisins.
