Etymology: The word "תחתאו" (pronounced "tachatav" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root ת-ח-ת, which means "under" or "beneath". The suffix או (-av) is a possessive suffix that means "his" or "its". Therefore, תחתאו literally means "under his" or "under its".

Grammar: תחתאו is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the masculine singular form. The ת (tav) at the beginning of the word indicates the definite article "the". The ח (chet) and ת (tav) in the root indicate the concept of being "under" or "beneath". The או (av) suffix indicates possession.

Description: תחתאו is used to describe something that is located or positioned beneath or under something else. It can refer to a physical location or a metaphorical concept.
