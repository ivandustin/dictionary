It is derived from the biblical commandment of "שְׁמִיטָה" (shemittah), which refers to the seventh year in the agricultural cycle in ancient Israel when the land was left fallow and debts were forgiven.

Description: "שְׁמִיתָה" (shemmitah) is a term used in Jewish law to refer to the Sabbatical year. It is observed every seventh year in the agricultural cycle, during which the land in Israel is left uncultivated. According to the biblical commandment, all agricultural activities, such as planting, pruning, and harvesting, are prohibited during this year. Additionally, all debts are released, and the land is considered to be communal property. The concept of shemittah is rooted in the belief that the land belongs to God and that observing this year of rest and release is a way to demonstrate trust in God's provision.
