Etymology: The word "מְשִׁיחַ" (Mashiach) comes from the Hebrew root word "מָשַׁח" (mashach), which means "to anoint" or "to smear with oil." In ancient times, anointing with oil was a ritual act performed to consecrate or set apart someone or something for a special purpose. The term "מְשִׁיחַ" (Mashiach) is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to individuals who were anointed for specific roles, such as kings, priests, and prophets.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "מְשִׁיחַ" (Mashiach) is a noun that is typically used with the definite article "הַ" (ha), which means "the." It can also be used without the definite article to refer to the concept of an anointed one or a messiah in a more general sense.

Description: The word "מְשִׁיחַ" (Mashiach) is commonly translated as "messiah" in English. In Jewish tradition, the term refers to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line who will be anointed with holy anointing oil and will bring peace, justice, and redemption to the world. In Christianity, the term "messiah" is used to refer to Jesus Christ, who is believed to be the fulfillment of the Jewish messianic prophecies.
