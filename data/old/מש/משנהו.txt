Etymology: The word "משנהו" (pronounced "mishnehoo") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שנה (sh-n-h), which means "to change" or "to alter." The prefix מ (m) indicates "from" or "someone/something." Therefore, "משנהו" can be translated as "from someone/something else" or "from another."

Grammar: "משנהו" is a pronoun in Hebrew that is used to refer to an unspecified or unknown person or thing. It is similar to the English pronouns "someone" or "something." It is often used when the speaker wants to refer to a person or thing without specifying their identity.

Description: "משנהו" is a versatile word that can be used in various contexts. It is commonly used in everyday conversations when referring to an unknown person or thing. For example, if someone asks, "Who left this book here?" and you don't know the answer, you can respond with "משנהו השאיר את הספר כאן" (mishnehoo hashi'er et hasefer kan), which means "Someone left the book here."
