Etymology: The word "מִשְׁפָּחָה" (mishpacha) comes from the Hebrew root שפח (sh-p-ch), which means "to join" or "to unite." It is derived from the noun שֶׁפֶח (shefekh), meaning "servant" or "maid," and the prefix מִ (mi), which denotes "from" or "belonging to." Therefore, "מִשְׁפָּחָה" can be understood as a group of people who are joined together or belong to the same household.
