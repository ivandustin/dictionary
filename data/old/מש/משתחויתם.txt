Etymology: The word "מִשְׁתַּחֲוִית" (mish-ta-cha-veet) is derived from the Hebrew root שׁ.ח.ו (sh.ch.v), which means "to bow down" or "to prostrate oneself." The word is formed by adding the prefix מִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה (mish-ta-cha-veh), which means "bowing down" or "prostration," to the suffix יִת (eet), which indicates a feminine noun.

Grammar: "מִשְׁתַּחֲוִית" is a feminine noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word can be modified by adding different prefixes or suffixes to indicate possession, tense, or other grammatical features.
