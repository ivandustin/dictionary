Etymology: The word "מִשְׁחַתְיָהוּ" (Mishchatyahu) is a Hebrew name that is composed of two elements. The first element, "מִשְׁחַת" (mishchat), means "anointing" or "ointment." The second element, "יָהוּ" (yahu), is a shortened form of the divine name "יהוה" (Yahweh). Therefore, the name "מִשְׁחַתְיָהוּ" (Mishchatyahu) can be translated as "anointing of Yahweh" or "Yahweh is my anointing."

Grammar: "מִשְׁחַתְיָהוּ" (Mishchatyahu) is a masculine Hebrew name. It is formed by combining the root "מִשְׁחַת" (mishchat) with the possessive suffix "-יָהוּ" (-yahu), which indicates "my" or "of." The name can be used as a given name for a person.

Description: The name "מִשְׁחַתְיָהוּ" (Mishchatyahu) is not commonly used in modern times. It is primarily known from the Hebrew Bible, where it appears as the name of several individuals. One notable figure with this name is Mishael, one of the three companions of Daniel who were thrown into the fiery furnace but miraculously survived.
