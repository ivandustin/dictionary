Etymology: The word "לרעתו" (lir'ato) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. The first part, "ל" (lamed), is a preposition meaning "to" or "for." The second part, "רעתו" (ra'ato), is a noun derived from the root רעה (ra'ah), which means "to shepherd" or "to tend to." Therefore, the literal translation of "לרעתו" is "to his/her/its shepherd" or "for his/her/its shepherd."

Grammar: "לרעתו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (lamed) indicates direction or purpose, and it is followed by the noun "רעתו" (ra'ato), which is in the possessive form. The possessive form indicates that the noun belongs to or is associated with someone or something. In this case, "רעתו" means "his/her/its shepherd."

Description: The phrase "לרעתו" is often used in Hebrew to express the idea of doing something for the benefit or well-being of someone or something. It implies a sense of care, protection, and guidance, similar to the role of a shepherd tending to their flock.
