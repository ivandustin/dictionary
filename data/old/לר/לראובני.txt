Etymology: The word "לראובני" (pronounced "le'ra'uv'ni") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "ל" (pronounced "le"), is a preposition meaning "to" or "for." The second part, "ראובני" (pronounced "ra'uv'ni"), is an adjective derived from the name "ראובן" (pronounced "ra'uv'en"), which is the Hebrew name for the biblical character Reuben. Therefore, "לראובני" can be translated as "to Reuben" or "for Reuben."

Grammar: "לראובני" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (pronounced "le") is used to indicate direction or purpose, and it is followed by the adjective "ראובני" (pronounced "ra'uv'ni"), which modifies the noun it refers to. In this case, "ראובני" describes something that is related to or associated with Reuben.

Description: The word "לראובני" is used in Hebrew to indicate something that is specifically related to or associated with Reuben. It can be used to describe a possession, an action, or a characteristic that is attributed to Reuben. For example, if someone says "זה ספר לראובני" (pronounced "ze sefer le'ra'uv'ni"), it means "this book is for Reuben" or "this book belongs to Reuben."
