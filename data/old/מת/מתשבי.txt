Etymology: The word "מתשבי" comes from the Hebrew root "שב" (shin-bet), which means "to sit" or "to dwell". The prefix "מ" (mem) indicates a plural form, so "מתשבי" can be translated as "those who dwell" or "inhabitants".

Grammar: "מתשבי" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the prefix "מ" (mem) to the root "שב" (shin-bet), and adding the suffix "י" (yod) to indicate plurality. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine), but "מתשבי" is a gender-neutral plural noun.

Description: "מתשבי" is a term used in Hebrew to refer to inhabitants or residents. It can be used to describe people who live in a specific place or region. The word can be used in various contexts, such as discussing the population of a city, country, or community.
