Etymology: The word "מתלקחת" (matlakhechet) is derived from the Hebrew root לקח (l-kh-kh), which means "to take" or "to receive". The prefix מ (m) indicates the passive form, so מתלקחת can be translated as "being taken" or "being received".

Grammar: מתלקחת is a feminine singular verb form in the present tense. It is conjugated in the passive voice, indicating that the subject is receiving the action of the verb.

Description: מתלקחת is used to describe something or someone that is being taken or received. It implies a passive role, indicating that the subject is not actively taking or receiving, but rather being acted upon.
