Etymology: The word "מתאבל" (pronounced "metabel" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root אבל (aval), which means "to mourn" or "to grieve". The prefix מ (mem) indicates the causative form, so מתאבל literally means "causing mourning" or "causing grief".

Grammar: מתאבל is a verb in the present tense, third person singular form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject and tense of the sentence. The prefix מ (mem) indicates the causative form, and the root אבל (aval) is the base of the verb.

Description: מתאבל is used to describe the act of mourning or grieving. It is often used to refer to the process of expressing sorrow or sadness after the death of a loved one. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a state of deep sadness or mourning over a loss or tragedy.
