Etymology: The word "מְתוֹקֵן" (metoken) is derived from the Hebrew root תקן (t-k-n), which means "to fix" or "to repair". It is formed by adding the prefix מְ (me-) which indicates the passive voice, and the suffix ן (-en) which indicates the past participle form.

Grammar: "מְתוֹקֵן" (metoken) is a masculine singular adjective in the past participle form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine singular, the adjective would be "מְתוֹקֶנֶת" (metokenet). If the noun is plural, the adjective would be "מְתוֹקְנִים" (metokenim) for masculine plural or "מְתוֹקְנוֹת" (metokenot) for feminine plural.

Description: The word "מְתוֹקֵן" (metoken) means "fixed" or "repaired" in Hebrew. It is used to describe something that has been restored to a proper or functional state after being damaged or broken.
