Etymology: The word "מתעבר" (pronounced "meta'aber") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עבר (pronounced "avar"), which means "to pass" or "to cross over." The prefix מ (pronounced "me") indicates the action of doing something, so "מתעבר" can be translated as "passing" or "crossing over."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "מתעבר" is a verb in the present tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the binyan (verb structure) called "פָּעַל" (pronounced "pa'al"), which is one of the seven verb binyanim in Hebrew. The verb "מתעבר" is conjugated differently in other tenses and forms to match the subject and the tense of the sentence.

Description: The word "מתעבר" is used to describe the action of passing or crossing over from one place to another. It can be used in a literal sense, such as crossing a street or a river, or in a figurative sense, such as transitioning from one stage of life to another.
