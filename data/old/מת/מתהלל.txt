Etymology: The word "מתהלל" (metahelal) is derived from the Hebrew root ה.ל.ל (h.l.l), which means "to praise" or "to boast". The prefix מ (me) indicates the causative form, so מתהלל can be translated as "causing to praise" or "causing to boast".

Grammar: In Hebrew, מתהלל is a verb in the present tense, third person singular form. It can also be conjugated in other tenses and forms to match different subjects and contexts.

Description: מתהלל is used to describe someone who boasts or brags about their achievements, qualities, or possessions. It implies a sense of arrogance or excessive pride in oneself.
