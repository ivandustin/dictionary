Etymology: The word "נפרדים" (Nifradim) is a Hebrew word derived from the root פרד, which means "to separate" or "to divide". The prefix נ- (n-) indicates the passive voice, so נפרדים can be translated as "being separated" or "being divided".

Grammar: נפרדים is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the root נפרד. The plural form indicates that there are multiple entities or individuals that are being separated or divided.

Description: נפרדים is used to describe things or people that are separated or divided from each other. It can refer to physical separation, such as two objects that are no longer together, or it can refer to a more abstract separation, such as people who are no longer in contact or have different opinions.
