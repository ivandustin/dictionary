Etymology: The word "הַצְרוּעַ" (HaTzrua) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צ-ר-ע (ts-r-a), which means "to be afflicted" or "to be troubled."

Grammar: "הַצְרוּעַ" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the masculine gender and singular form. It can also be used as an adjective to describe something or someone afflicted or troubled.

Description: "הַצְרוּעַ" is often used to refer to a person who is afflicted with a skin disease, particularly the biblical condition known as "tzara'at." In the Bible, tzara'at is described as a physical affliction that can affect the skin, hair, or even clothing. It is often associated with impurity and requires isolation and purification rituals.

In modern usage, "הַצְרוּעַ" can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is troubled or afflicted in a broader sense, not necessarily related to a specific skin disease.
