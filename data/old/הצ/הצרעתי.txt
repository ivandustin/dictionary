Etymology: The word "הַצְרֵעַתִי" (pronounced "ha-tz'ra'ati") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צ-ר-ע, which means "to be afflicted" or "to be struck with a skin disease." It is derived from the noun צָרַעַת (tzara'at), which refers to a specific type of skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

Grammar: "הַצְרֵעַתִי" is a Hebrew adjective that means "leper" or "afflicted with tzara'at." It is in the masculine singular form. The prefix הַ (ha) means "the," and the root צ-ר-ע is modified to fit the grammatical structure.

Description: "הַצְרֵעַתִי" is used to describe someone who has been afflicted with tzara'at, a skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. In biblical times, individuals with tzara'at were considered unclean and were required to live outside the community until they were declared clean by a priest. The term can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is socially isolated or shunned.
