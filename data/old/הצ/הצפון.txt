Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַצְפוּן" (HaTzafon) comes from the root צ.פ.נ (ts.p.n), which means "to hide" or "to conceal." It is derived from the noun צָפוֹן (tzafon), meaning "north." The connection between hiding and the north may be related to the fact that the north is often colder and darker, creating a sense of concealment.

Grammar: "הַצְפוּן" (HaTzafon) is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is preceded by the definite article "הַ" (ha), which means "the." In Hebrew, nouns are inflected for gender, number, and definiteness.
