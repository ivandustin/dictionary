Etymology: The word "יקרני" (pronounced "yekarni") is a Hebrew adjective derived from the root י-ק-ר (y-k-r), which means "to be precious" or "to be valuable." The suffix ני (-ni) indicates possession or belonging, so יקרני means "my precious" or "my valuable."

Grammar: יקרני is in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: יקרני is used to describe something or someone that is highly valued, cherished, or esteemed. It can refer to a person, an object, or an abstract concept. It conveys a sense of importance, worth, or significance.
