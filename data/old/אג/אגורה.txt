Etymology: The word "אגורה" (agorah) comes from Hebrew and is derived from the root word "גרה" (gara), which means "to dwell" or "to abide." It is related to the concept of living or residing in a specific place.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "אגורה" (agorah) is a feminine noun. It is used to refer to a specific unit of currency, particularly the Israeli agora, which was the subunit of the Israeli pound until it was replaced by the agora in 1980.

Description: The agora was a monetary unit used in Israel from 1960 to 1980. It was equal to 1/100 of the Israeli pound. The agora coins were used for small transactions, similar to cents or pennies in other currencies. The term "agorah" is still used colloquially in Israel to refer to a small amount of money.
