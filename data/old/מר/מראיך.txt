Etymology: The word "מראית" (pronounced "mar'it" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root ראה (ra'ah), which means "to see". The word is formed by adding the prefix מ (mem) to the root, which indicates the causative form of the verb. Therefore, "מראית" can be translated as "causing to see" or "making visible".
