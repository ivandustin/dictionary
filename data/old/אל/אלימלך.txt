Etymology: The word "אלימלך" (pronounced "Elimelech") is a Hebrew name that appears in the Bible. It is composed of two elements: "אל" (El), which means "God" in Hebrew, and "מלך" (melech), which means "king" in Hebrew. Therefore, the name can be translated as "God is my king" or "my God is king."

Grammar: "אלימלך" is a masculine proper noun in Hebrew. It is written with five Hebrew letters: א (aleph), ל (lamed), י (yod), מ (mem), and ך (final kaf). The name follows the pattern of many Hebrew names, combining a divine element (אל) with a descriptive element (מלך).

Description: In the Bible, Elimelech is the name of a man from Bethlehem who, along with his wife Naomi and their two sons, moves to Moab due to a famine in their land. Elimelech's sons marry Moabite women, but all three men die, leaving Naomi and her daughters-in-law widowed. Elimelech's story is primarily found in the Book of Ruth in the Hebrew Bible.
