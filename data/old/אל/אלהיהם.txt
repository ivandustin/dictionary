Etymology: The word "אלהיהם" (pronounced "elohim") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "אלה" (pronounced "eloh"). It is a combination of the word "אל" (pronounced "el"), which means "god," and the plural suffix "-ים" (pronounced "-im"), which indicates plurality. Therefore, "אלהיהם" can be translated as "their gods" or "their divine beings."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "אלהיהם" is a possessive noun phrase that consists of the word "אלהים" (pronounced "elohim"), meaning "gods" or "divine beings," and the possessive suffix "-הם" (pronounced "-hem"), which means "their." The suffix "-הם" is used to indicate possession or ownership by a plural masculine noun.

Description: "אלהיהם" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to the gods or divine beings of other nations. It is often used to contrast with the singular form "אלהים" (elohim), which refers to the God of Israel. The plural form "אלהים" can also be used as a generic term for gods or deities in a more general sense.
