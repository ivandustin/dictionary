Etymology: The word "אלף" (aleph) comes from the Hebrew alphabet, specifically the first letter. The word "למד" (lamed) means "to learn" or "to teach." When combined, "אלף-למד" (aleph-lamed) forms the word "אלף" (aleph), which means "ox" or "bull." This is because the original pictograph for the letter aleph resembled the head of an ox.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "אלף" (aleph) is a noun and can be used in both singular and plural forms. It can also be used as a prefix to form other words, such as "אלפים" (alafim), which means "thousand."

Description: "אלף" (aleph) is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and has a numerical value of 1. It is a silent letter and does not have a specific sound of its own. However, it is often used as a vowel placeholder or as a consonant with a glottal stop. In Hebrew words, it can also represent the sound of a long "a" or a short "e."
