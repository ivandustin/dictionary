Etymology: The word "אלמנותיך" is derived from the Hebrew root א-ל-מ-ן, which means "widowhood" or "widow." The suffix ותיך (-utayikh) indicates possession or belonging, so אלמנותיך (almonotayikh) can be translated as "your widowhood" or "your state of being a widow."

Grammar: אלמנותיך is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, and they can be declined to indicate possession. The word is formed by adding the suffix ותיך (-utayikh) to the root א-ל-מ-ן.

Description: אלמנותיך refers to the state or condition of being a widow. It can be used to describe the experience, status, or period of time after a woman's husband has died.
