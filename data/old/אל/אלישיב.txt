Etymology: The word "אלישיב" (pronounced "Elishiv" in English) is a Hebrew name that has biblical origins. It is composed of two elements: "אלי" (Eli), meaning "my God," and "שיב" (shiv), meaning "return" or "repentance." Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "my God is my return" or "my God is my repentance."

Grammar: "אלישיב" is a masculine Hebrew name. It is formed by combining the root letters א-ל-ש-ב (aleph-lamed-shin-bet) with the masculine suffix יב (-iv). The name can also be spelled as אלישב (Elishav) or אלישבע (Elishava) for feminine forms.

Description: "אלישיב" is a relatively uncommon Hebrew name. In the Bible, Elishiv is mentioned as a high priest during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. The name carries connotations of devotion to God and the concept of repentance. It is often given to boys born in Jewish families who wish to honor their religious heritage.
