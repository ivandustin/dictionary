Etymology: The word "והרא" (v'ha'ra) is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two words: "וה" (v'ha) meaning "and the" and "רא" (ra) meaning "see" or "look". 

Grammar: "והרא" is a combination of the conjunction "וה" (v'ha) and the verb "רא" (ra). The conjunction "וה" (v'ha) is used to connect two nouns or noun phrases, and it means "and the". The verb "רא" (ra) is the imperative form of the verb "to see" or "to look". So, "והרא" can be translated as "and see" or "and look".

Description: "והרא" is a phrase that is often used in Hebrew to introduce a command or instruction. It is similar to the English phrase "and behold" or "and see". It is used to draw attention to something or to emphasize the importance of what is being said.
