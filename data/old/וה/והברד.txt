Description: "והברד" (v'habarad) refers to the natural occurrence of hail, which is a form of solid precipitation consisting of balls or irregular lumps of ice. Hail is typically formed in severe thunderstorms when updrafts carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze and accumulate layers of ice. Hailstones can vary in size, from small pellets to large stones, and can cause damage to property and crops.
