Etymology: The word "והעגלה" (v'ha'eglah) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "וה" (v'ha), which means "and the," and "עגלה" (eglah), which means "heifer" or "young cow."

Grammar: "והעגלה" (v'ha'eglah) is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "וה" (v'ha) is a conjunction meaning "and the," and "עגלה" (eglah) is the noun meaning "heifer" or "young cow." In Hebrew, the noun usually comes before the article, so "עגלה" (eglah) is placed after "וה" (v'ha) to form the phrase.

Description: "והעגלה" (v'ha'eglah) is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 21:28-32) and refers to a specific ritual described in the text. According to the ritual, if a person's ox kills another person's ox, the owner of the ox that caused the death must bring an "והעגלה" (v'ha'eglah), a heifer, to be killed as a form of atonement. The ritual involves breaking the heifer's neck and washing the hands over its body to symbolize innocence. This ritual was a way to resolve disputes and bring about justice in ancient Hebrew society.
