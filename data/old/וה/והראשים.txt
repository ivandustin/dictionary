Etymology: The word "והראשים" (v'harashim) is a Hebrew word that translates to "and the heads" in English. It is a combination of the conjunction "ו" (v') meaning "and" and the noun "הראשים" (harashim) meaning "the heads".

Grammar: "והראשים" (v'harashim) is a phrase composed of two parts. The first part is the conjunction "ו" (v') which is used to connect words or phrases. The second part is the noun "הראשים" (harashim) which is the plural form of the noun "ראש" (rosh) meaning "head". In Hebrew, the noun agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies, so "הראשים" (harashim) is used when referring to multiple heads.

Description: The phrase "והראשים" (v'harashim) is commonly used in Hebrew to introduce a list of people or things. It is often used in biblical texts to refer to the leaders or chiefs of a group.
