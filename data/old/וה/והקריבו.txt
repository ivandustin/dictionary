Etymology: The word "והקריבו" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק.ר.ב (k.r.b), which means "to come near" or "to approach." The prefix ו (vav) means "and," and ה (he) is a definite article that means "the." Therefore, והקריבו can be translated as "and they shall bring near" or "and they shall approach."

Grammar: והקריבו is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the plural form and in the future tense. The prefix ו (vav) indicates the third person plural, and the suffix ו (vav) indicates the future tense. The root ק.ר.ב (k.r.b) is conjugated in the hif'il (causative) form, which means that the subject is causing someone or something else to come near or approach.

Description: והקריבו is used in the context of religious rituals and sacrifices in the Hebrew Bible. It is often translated as "and they shall bring" or "and they shall offer." The word implies the act of bringing something closer to a sacred place or person as an offering or sacrifice. It is commonly used in the instructions for the Israelites' worship practices in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple.
