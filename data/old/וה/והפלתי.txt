Etymology: The word "וְהַפְּלֵטִי" (pronounced "v'hapleti") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פלט (p-l-t), which means "to escape" or "to deliver." The prefix וְ (v') means "and" or "the," and the suffix י (i) indicates the first person singular possessive form. Therefore, "וְהַפְּלֵטִי" can be translated as "and my deliverer" or "and the one who delivers me."

Grammar: In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number. "וְהַפְּלֵטִי" is a masculine singular noun. The prefix וְ (v') is the conjunction "and," and the definite article הַ (ha) means "the." The root פלט (p-l-t) is in the construct state, indicating possession or relationship. The suffix י (i) indicates the first person singular possessive form.

Description: "וְהַפְּלֵטִי" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to God as the deliverer or rescuer. It is often used in poetic or prophetic texts to express trust and reliance on God's protection and salvation.
