Etymology: The word "והנו" (pronounced "v'hinu") is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "and behold" or "and lo" in English. It is a combination of the conjunction "ו" (pronounced "v") meaning "and" and the adverb "הנה" (pronounced "hinneh") meaning "behold" or "lo".

Grammar: "והנו" is composed of two parts: the conjunction "ו" (v) and the adverb "הנה" (hinneh). The conjunction "ו" is used to connect words, phrases, or clauses in Hebrew sentences. The adverb "הנה" is used to draw attention to something or to introduce a surprising or unexpected element in a sentence.

Description: "והנו" is often used in biblical or poetic Hebrew to introduce a new element or to emphasize a point. It is similar to the English phrase "and behold" or "and lo" and is used to draw attention to something significant or unexpected.
