Etymology: The word "והתפארת" (v'hitpa'arta) is a Hebrew verb form derived from the root פאר (pa'ar), which means "to glorify" or "to boast." The prefix והת (v'hit) indicates reflexive action, so the word can be translated as "and you shall glorify yourself" or "and you shall boast."

Grammar: "והתפארת" is the second person singular future tense form of the verb פאר (pa'ar) in the reflexive hif'il (הִתְפַּעֵר) conjugation. In Hebrew grammar, the hif'il conjugation is used to express causative or reflexive actions. The future tense form indicates that the action will happen in the future.
