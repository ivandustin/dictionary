Etymology: The word "והרשענו" (pronounced "veharesha'nu") is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "and we have sinned" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root ח.ט.א (chet-tet-aleph), which means "to sin" or "to miss the mark."

Grammar: "והרשענו" is a verb phrase in the first person plural form. The prefix "ו" (pronounced "v") means "and," and the root ח.ט.א is conjugated in the past tense. The suffix "נו" (pronounced "nu") indicates the first person plural pronoun "we."

Description: "והרשענו" is a confession of sin in the Jewish tradition. It is often recited during the High Holy Days, particularly on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. This phrase is part of the Vidui (confession) prayer, where individuals acknowledge their sins and seek forgiveness from God. It is a way to take responsibility for one's actions and express remorse.
