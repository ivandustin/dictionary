Etymology: The word "והמיתו" is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: "ו" (pronounced "vav"), which means "and", "המית" (pronounced "hamit"), which means "to kill", and "ו" (pronounced "vav"), which again means "and". So, the literal translation of "והמיתו" is "and they will kill".

Grammar: "והמיתו" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the future tense, masculine plural, and third person. It is derived from the root word "מות" (pronounced "mut"), which means "to die". The prefix "ו" (pronounced "vav") indicates the conjunction "and", and the suffix "ו" (pronounced "vav") indicates the future tense.

Description: "והמיתו" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and is often translated as "and they shall put to death" or "and they will kill". It is used to describe an action of killing or causing someone's death, usually in a legal or judicial context.
