Etymology: The word "וְהָעִי" (pronounced "v'ha'ee") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ו.ה (Ayin-Vav-Hei), which means "to be" or "to exist." The prefix וְ (v') means "and," and the definite article הָ (ha) means "the." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and the existing one" or "and the one who is."
