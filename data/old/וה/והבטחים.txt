Etymology: The word "והבטחים" (v'habtachim) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בטח (b.t.ch), which means "to trust" or "to rely on." The prefix ו (vav) means "and," and the suffix ים (im) indicates plural. Therefore, והבטחים can be translated as "and the trusters" or "and those who trust."

Grammar: והבטחים is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns can be masculine or feminine, and they can be singular or plural. The plural form is often indicated by adding the suffix ים (im) to the singular form. In this case, the singular form would be בטח (batach), meaning "trust" or "reliance."

Description: והבטחים is a word that refers to a group of people who trust or rely on something or someone. It can be used to describe individuals who have faith or confidence in a particular belief, idea, or person. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe those who have trust in a higher power or divine entity.
