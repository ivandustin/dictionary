Etymology: The word "והחריש" (v'hacharish) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ח.ר.ש (ch.r.sh), which means "to plow" or "to till the soil." The prefix ו (vav) means "and," and ה (he) is a definite article that means "the." So, והחריש literally translates to "and the plow."

Grammar: והחריש is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word וה (v'ha) is a conjunction that means "and the," and חריש (charish) is the noun form of the verb חרש (charash), which means "to plow." In Hebrew, nouns are usually formed by adding a suffix to the root of the verb.

Description: והחריש is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to the act of plowing or tilling the soil. It is often used metaphorically to symbolize hard work, preparation, or the beginning of a new endeavor. The concept of plowing is significant in agricultural societies, as it is the first step in preparing the ground for planting crops.
