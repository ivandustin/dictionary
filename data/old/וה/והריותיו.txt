Etymology: The word "והריותיו" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "הרה" (hara), which means "to conceive" or "to become pregnant". The word is formed by adding the prefix "ו" (vav) which means "and", and the suffix "יו" (yod-vav) which indicates possession or ownership.

Grammar: "והריותיו" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the masculine plural form. The prefix "ו" (vav) indicates that it is in the construct state, which means it is used to connect two nouns together. The suffix "יו" (yod-vav) indicates possession or ownership, so it can be translated as "his pregnancies" or "his conceptions".

Description: The word "והריותיו" is not a commonly used word in everyday Hebrew conversation. It is a more formal or poetic term that is used to describe the pregnancies or conceptions of a male individual. It is often used in religious or biblical contexts to refer to the offspring or descendants of a male figure.
