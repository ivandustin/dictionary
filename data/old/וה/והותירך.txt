Etymology: The word "וַהוּאִירְדָּן" is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "יָרַד" (yarad), which means "to descend" or "to go down". The prefix "וַ" (va) is a conjunction that means "and". The word "הוּאִירְדָּן" (hu'irdan) is a combination of the pronoun "הוּא" (hu), which means "he" or "it", and the noun "יַרְדֵּן" (yarden), which is the name of the Jordan River.

Grammar: The word "וַהוּאִירְדָּן" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix "וַ" (va) is a conjunction that connects the noun phrase to the rest of the sentence. The pronoun "הוּא" (hu) is the subject of the sentence, and the noun "יַרְדֵּן" (yarden) is the object. In Hebrew, the word order is usually subject-verb-object, so "וַהוּאִירְדָּן" can be translated as "and he descended the Jordan" or "and it went down the Jordan".

Description: The word "וַהוּאִירְדָּן" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the Jordan River.

The Jordan River is a major river in the Middle East, flowing through Israel, Jordan, and the West Bank. It holds religious and historical significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims.
