Etymology: The word "והצלעות" (vahatzla'ot) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צ.ל.ע (ts.l.a), which means "side" or "rib". The prefix ו (vav) means "and", and ה (he) is the definite article "the". So, והצלעות literally means "and the sides" or "and the ribs".

Grammar: והצלעות is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word וה (vah) is a conjunction meaning "and", and צלעות (tzla'ot) is the plural form of the noun צלע (tzela), which means "side" or "rib". The definite article ה (ha) is added to make it "the sides" or "the ribs".

Description: והצלעות is used in Hebrew to refer to the sides or ribs of a person or an animal. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the sides or edges of an object or a concept.
