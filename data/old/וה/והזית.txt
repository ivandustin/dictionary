Etymology: The word "וַהֲזִית" (vahazit) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ז.י.ת (z.y.t), which means "to shine" or "to radiate." It is derived from the noun זִית (zayit), which means "olive."

Grammar: "וַהֲזִית" is a verb in the Hebrew language. It is in the future tense and is conjugated in the masculine singular form. The prefix "וַ" (va) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root ז.י.ת (z.y.t) is the core of the verb.

Description: The word "וַהֲזִית" is used in the Bible, specifically in the book of Zechariah 4:12. It is part of a vision in which the prophet Zechariah sees a golden menorah (a seven-branched candelabrum) with two olive trees on either side. The olive trees represent the anointed ones who stand before the Lord, and the word "וַהֲזִית" is used to describe the olive trees' action of pouring oil into the menorah, symbolizing the continuous flow of divine light and blessing.
