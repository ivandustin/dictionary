Etymology: The word "והזהב" (v'ha'zahav) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "וה" (v'ha), which means "and the," and "זהב" (zahav), which means "gold." 

Grammar: "והזהב" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "וה" (v'ha) is a conjunction meaning "and the," and it is used to connect the noun "זהב" (zahav), which means "gold." In Hebrew, the noun comes before the adjective, so "זהב" (zahav) is placed after "וה" (v'ha) to form the phrase "והזהב" (v'ha'zahav), meaning "and the gold."

Description: "והזהב" (v'ha'zahav) is a phrase commonly used in Hebrew to refer to gold. It can be used to describe the material itself or to indicate something made of gold. The phrase is often used in religious or ceremonial contexts, such as in descriptions of the Temple in Jerusalem or in prayers and blessings.
