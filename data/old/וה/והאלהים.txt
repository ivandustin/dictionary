Grammar: "והאלהים" is a combination of the conjunction "וה" (meaning "and the") and the noun "אלהים" (meaning "God" or "gods"). In Hebrew, the word order is usually subject-verb-object, so "והאלהים" can be translated as "and the God" or "and the gods" depending on the context.

Description: "והאלהים" is a phrase commonly used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to the God of Israel. It appears numerous times throughout the text and is often used to emphasize the divine nature of God. The phrase can also be used to refer to other gods in a more general sense.
