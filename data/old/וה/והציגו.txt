Etymology: The word "והציגו" (v'hatsigu) is a Hebrew verb in the future tense, derived from the root צ.ו.ג (ts.w.g), which means "to present" or "to display".

Grammar: "והציגו" is a third-person plural verb in the future tense. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated based on the subject and the tense of the sentence. The prefix "ו" (vav) indicates the future tense, and the root צ.ו.ג (ts.w.g) is modified to match the subject.
