Etymology: The word "והמליטה" (vahamelitah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root letters מ-ל-ט (m-l-t), which means "to deliver" or "to rescue." The prefix ו- (vav) in front of the root indicates the conjunction "and," and the suffix ה- (he) indicates the definite article "the." Therefore, "והמליטה" can be translated as "and the deliverance" or "and the rescue."
