Etymology: The word "והנבאתי" (pronounced "vehanavati") is a Hebrew word. It is a combination of the conjunction "ו" (meaning "and") and the verb "הנבאתי" (meaning "I prophesied").

Grammar: "והנבאתי" is a verb form in the past tense, first person singular. It is derived from the root נ.ב.א (n.b.a), which means "to prophesy" or "to foretell." The prefix "ו" (vav) is a conjunction that connects the verb to the previous clause or sentence.

Description: "והנבאתי" is used to express the action of prophesying or foretelling something. It indicates that the speaker (in this case, the first person singular) has engaged in the act of prophesying. The word can be found in various religious texts and is often used in the context of divine revelations or predictions of future events.
