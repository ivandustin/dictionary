Etymology: The word "והסריסים" (v'hasarisim) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root סרס (srs), which means "to castrate" or "to emasculate." The prefix וה (v') means "and the," and the suffix ים (im) indicates plural masculine. Therefore, והסריסים literally translates to "and the castrated ones" or "and the eunuchs."

Grammar: והסריסים is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word והסריסים is masculine and plural, indicating that it refers to multiple castrated individuals.

Description: והסריסים is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to eunuchs or castrated men. In ancient times, eunuchs were often employed as servants or officials in royal courts, as they were considered to be trustworthy and less likely to have ulterior motives. The term והסריסים appears in several biblical passages, including Isaiah 56:3-5 and Jeremiah 38:7-13.
