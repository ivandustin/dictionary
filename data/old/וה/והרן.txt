Grammar: "והרן" is a combination of the conjunction "וה" (meaning "and") and the proper noun "הרן" (meaning "Aaron"). In Hebrew, the word order is usually subject-verb-object, so "והרן" can be translated as "and Aaron" or "and the Aaron".

Description: "והרן" is used in Hebrew to connect two nouns or phrases, indicating that both are present or involved in a certain context. It is often used in biblical texts to refer to the biblical figure Aaron, who was the older brother of Moses and the first high priest of the Israelites.
