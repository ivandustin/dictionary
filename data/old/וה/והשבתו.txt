It is part of the phrase "וַיְכַל אֱלֹהִים בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה וַיִּשְׁבֹּת בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי מִכָּל מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה" (vayekhal Elohim bayom hashvi'i melakhto asher asah vayishbot bayom hashvi'i mikol melakhto asher asah), which translates to "And God finished on the seventh day His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work that He had done." This phrase refers to the concept of the Sabbath, a day of rest and cessation from work.
