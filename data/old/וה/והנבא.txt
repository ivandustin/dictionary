Etymology: The word "והנבא" (pronounced "v'hanava") is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "and the prophet" in English. It is composed of two parts: "וה" (pronounced "v'ha"), which means "and the," and "נבא" (pronounced "hanava"), which means "prophet."

Grammar: "והנבא" is a combination of the Hebrew conjunction "וה" (v'ha), which means "and the," and the noun "נבא" (hanava), which means "prophet." In Hebrew, nouns are inflected for gender, number, and definiteness. The word "נבא" is in the singular masculine form, and when combined with the conjunction "וה," it becomes "והנבא" to indicate "and the prophet."

It is often used in religious or biblical contexts to indicate the presence or involvement of a prophet in a particular situation or narrative. The phrase can be found in various Hebrew texts, including the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and other religious writings.
