Etymology: The word "רְקוּעַ" (rekua) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ר-ק-ע (r-q-a), which means "to bend" or "to curve."

Grammar: In Hebrew, רְקוּעַ is a noun that is used to describe a specific type of architectural element. It is commonly translated as "arch" or "vault" in English.

Description: רְקוּעַ refers to a curved or arched structure that is used to support the weight of a roof or ceiling. It is often found in traditional architecture, particularly in religious buildings such as synagogues and churches. The use of רְקוּעַ allows for the creation of large open spaces without the need for additional support columns.
