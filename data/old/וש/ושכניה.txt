Etymology: The word "וְשַׁכְבֵנִיָּה" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שכב (sh.k.b), which means "to lie down" or "to sleep." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the suffix יָּה (yah) is a shortened form of the divine name יהוה (Yahweh). Therefore, the word can be translated as "and lie down with Yahweh" or "and sleep with Yahweh."

Grammar: The word "וְשַׁכְבֵנִיָּה" is a verb in the imperative form. It is conjugated in the second person singular, addressing a male. The prefix וְ (vav) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root שכב (sh.k.b) is conjugated in the hif'il causative stem. The suffix יָּה (yah) is added to the root to indicate the divine name Yahweh.

Description: The word "וְשַׁכְבֵנִיָּה" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in Psalm 3:6. In this verse, King David is expressing his trust in God's protection, saying, "I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side. Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people." The phrase "וְשַׁכְבֵנִיָּה" is a plea for God to protect and watch over the speaker while he sleeps. It signifies a deep trust in God's care and a desire for divine intervention and guidance even during times of rest.
