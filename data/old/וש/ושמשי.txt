Etymology: The word "וְשַׁמְשִׁי" (v'shamshi) is a Hebrew word that means "and my sun." It is derived from the root שֶׁמֶשׁ (shemesh), which means "sun."

Grammar: "וְשַׁמְשִׁי" is a possessive form of the word "שֶׁמֶשׁ" (shemesh), which means "sun." The prefix "וְ" (v') means "and," and the suffix "-י" (-i) indicates possession, meaning "my." Therefore, "וְשַׁמְשִׁי" translates to "and my sun."

Description: "וְשַׁמְשִׁי" is a poetic expression used in Hebrew literature and songs to symbolize a loved one or someone who brings light and warmth into one's life, similar to the way the sun does. It is often used to express affection or endearment towards someone.
