Etymology: The word "וֶשְׁכָּנִיְהוּ" (pronounced "veshkaniahu") is a Hebrew name that appears in the Bible. It is a combination of two Hebrew words: "וֶשֶׁכֶן" (meaning "dweller" or "inhabitant") and "יָהוּ" (a shortened form of the name of God, Yahweh). Therefore, the name can be translated as "Yahweh is my dweller" or "Yahweh is my inhabitant."

Grammar: "וֶשְׁכָּנִיְהוּ" is a masculine Hebrew name. It is formed by adding the suffix "-יְהוּ" to the root word "שָׁכַן" (meaning "to dwell" or "to inhabit"). The prefix "וֶ" indicates the possessive form, meaning "my" or "of."

Description: "וֶשְׁכָּנִיְהוּ" is a biblical name that is mentioned in the Old Testament. It appears in the books of 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles as the name of a Levite who was appointed as a gatekeeper in the temple of Jerusalem. The name signifies a strong connection to God and a sense of dwelling in His presence.
