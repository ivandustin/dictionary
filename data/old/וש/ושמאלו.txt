Etymology: The word "וְשִׁמְאֵלוֹ" (pronounced "ve-shim'elo") is a Hebrew name composed of two elements. "וְ" (ve) means "and" in Hebrew, and "שִׁמְאֵל" (Shim'el) is a Hebrew name derived from the root word "שֵׁם" (shem), meaning "name," and the Hebrew word "אֵל" (el), meaning "God." Therefore, the name "וְשִׁמְאֵלוֹ" can be translated as "and God's name" or "and God has heard."

Grammar: "וְשִׁמְאֵלוֹ" is a masculine Hebrew name in the third person singular form. The prefix "וְ" (ve) means "and," and "שִׁמְאֵלוֹ" (Shim'elo) is the name itself.
