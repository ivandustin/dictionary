Etymology: The word "וְשֵׁם" (pronounced "v'shem") is a Hebrew word that means "and name." It is derived from the Hebrew root שׁ-מ-ה (sh-m-h), which means "to name" or "to designate."

Grammar: "וְשֵׁם" is a combination of two Hebrew words: "וְ" (pronounced "v") meaning "and," and "שֵׁם" (pronounced "shem") meaning "name." In Hebrew grammar, "וְ" is a conjunction that connects words or phrases, and "שֵׁם" is a noun that refers to the title or designation of a person, place, or thing.

Description: The word "וְשֵׁם" is often used in Hebrew to introduce or specify the name of someone or something. It is commonly used in biblical texts to indicate the name of a person, such as "וְשֵׁם הָאִישׁ" (the name of the man) or "וְשֵׁם הָעִיר" (the name of the city). It is also used in modern Hebrew to introduce the name of a person or object in a sentence.
