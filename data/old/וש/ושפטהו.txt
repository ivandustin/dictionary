Etymology: The word "וְשַׁפְתֵּהוּ" (pronounced "v'shaftayhu") is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts: "וְ" (pronounced "v'") which means "and" and "שַׁפְתֵּהוּ" (pronounced "shaftayhu") which means "his lips". 

Grammar: "וְשַׁפְתֵּהוּ" is a verb phrase in the Hebrew language. The "וְ" at the beginning of the phrase is a conjunction that means "and". The word "שַׁפְתֵּהוּ" is a verb form that means "his lips". In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated to match the subject of the sentence, so "שַׁפְתֵּהוּ" indicates that the subject is masculine and singular.

Description: The phrase "וְשַׁפְתֵּהוּ" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Isaiah 6:7. It is part of a vision that the prophet Isaiah has, where he sees seraphim (angelic beings) praising God. In this particular verse, one of the seraphim takes a coal from the altar and touches Isaiah's lips with it, symbolizing the purification of his lips and his readiness to speak on behalf of God. The phrase "וְשַׁפְתֵּהוּ" is used to describe this action of touching Isaiah's lips.
