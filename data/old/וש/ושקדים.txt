Etymology: The word "וֶשְׁקַדִּים" (veshkadim) is derived from the Hebrew root שקד (sh.k.d), which means "to watch" or "to be alert." It is related to the noun שָׁקֵד (shaked), which means "almond tree" or "almond."

Grammar: "וֶשְׁקַדִּים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the singular form, which is שָׁקֵד (shaked). The word is masculine and is used to refer to almond trees or almonds themselves.

Description: The word "וֶשְׁקַדִּים" is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the context of the construction of the Tabernacle and the Temple. Almond trees were highly valued in ancient Israel for their beautiful blossoms and nutritious nuts. The almond tree is also associated with watchfulness and alertness, as its Hebrew root implies.
