Etymology: The word "וְשִׁמְאוֹל" (pronounced "v'shim'ol") is a Hebrew name that is derived from the combination of two words: "וְ" (pronounced "v'") meaning "and" and "שְׁמוּאֵל" (pronounced "sh'mu'el") meaning "name of God" or "heard by God". Therefore, the name "וְשִׁמְאוֹל" can be translated as "and God heard" or "and God has heard".

Grammar: "וְשִׁמְאוֹל" is a masculine Hebrew name that consists of two parts. The first part, "וְ" (pronounced "v'"), is a conjunction meaning "and". The second part, "שְׁמוּאֵל" (pronounced "sh'mu'el"), is a proper noun meaning "name of God" or "heard by God".

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, "וְשִׁמְאוֹל" refers to a significant figure named Samuel. Samuel was a prophet and the last judge of Israel before the establishment of the monarchy. He played a crucial role in anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. The name "וְשִׁמְאוֹל" carries a sense of divine connection and hearing from God.
