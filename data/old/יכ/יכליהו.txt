Etymology: The word "יכליהו" (Yekhlihu) is a Hebrew name that is derived from the combination of two Hebrew words: "יכל" (yekhol) meaning "able" or "capable," and "יהו" (Yahu) which is a shortened form of the name of God, Yahweh. Therefore, "יכליהו" can be interpreted as "God is able" or "God is capable."

Grammar: "יכליהו" is a masculine Hebrew name. It consists of four Hebrew letters: י (yod), כ (kaf), ל (lamed), and ה (he). In Hebrew, names are often formed by combining root words or adding suffixes or prefixes to existing words. In this case, the root word "יכל" (yekhol) is combined with the suffix "יהו" (Yahu) to form the name "יכליהו" (Yekhlihu).

Description: "יכליהו" is a biblical name that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). It is the name of a prophet mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 36:14). Yekhlihu was one of the scribes who helped Jeremiah in writing down the prophecies and messages from God. The name signifies the belief in God's ability and power.
