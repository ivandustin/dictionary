Etymology: The word "וְגִיד" (pronounced "vegid" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root ג.ו.ד (g.w.d), which means "to bind" or "to tie." 

Grammar: "וְגִיד" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to a tendon or sinew in the body. It is often used in the context of the biblical story of Jacob wrestling with an angel, where Jacob's hip is dislocated and his gid hanasheh (sciatic nerve) is affected.

Description: The gid is a tough, fibrous tissue that connects muscles to bones. It is responsible for transmitting the force generated by muscles to the bones, allowing movement. In Jewish dietary laws, the gid hanasheh is considered a forbidden part of an animal and must be removed before consumption.
