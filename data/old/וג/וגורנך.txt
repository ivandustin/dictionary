Description: "וְגוֹרֵן" refers to a threshing floor, which is a flat surface where grain is separated from the chaff. In ancient times, it was a common agricultural practice to thresh the harvested grain by beating it or trampling it underfoot on a threshing floor. The chaff would then be separated from the grain by winnowing. Threshing floors were typically located outdoors and were often made of hard-packed earth or stone. They played a crucial role in the process of grain production and were an important part of agricultural life in ancient times.
