Description: "וְגֵת" refers to a device or structure used for pressing grapes or other fruits to extract their juice. In ancient times, a winepress was typically a large pit or trough where grapes were placed and then crushed by people or by a heavy stone or wooden beam. The juice would flow into a collection container, where it would be further processed to make wine.

Today, the word "וְגֵת" can also be used metaphorically to describe a place or situation where there is a lot of pressure or intensity, similar to the process of squeezing grapes in a winepress.
