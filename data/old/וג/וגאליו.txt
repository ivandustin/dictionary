Etymology: The word "וְגָאֳלִיו" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root גאל (ga'al), which means "to redeem" or "to buy back." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix יו (yo) indicates the third person possessive pronoun "his." Therefore, וְגָאֳלִיו can be translated as "and his redeemer" or "and his buyer."

Grammar: וְגָאֳלִיו is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix וְ (ve) is a conjunction meaning "and," connecting the noun phrase to another element in the sentence. The root גאל (ga'al) is a verb that has been transformed into a noun by adding the suffix יו (yo), which indicates possession. The noun גָאֳלִיו (ga'oliyo) can be translated as "his redeemer" or "his buyer."

Description: וְגָאֳלִיו is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to a person who has the legal right and responsibility to redeem or buy back something that belongs to another person. In the context of biblical law, the term often refers to a close relative who has the duty to redeem a family member's property or to marry their widow in order to continue the family line. The concept of redemption and the role of the redeemer are significant themes in Hebrew culture and religious traditions.
