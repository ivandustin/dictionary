Etymology: The word "לשפתו" (leshono) comes from the Hebrew root "לשן" (lashon), which means "tongue" or "language". It is derived from the Semitic root "לשן" (lashan), which has a similar meaning in other Semitic languages.

Grammar: "לשפתו" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the construct state, indicating possession or association. The word is composed of the preposition "ל" (le), meaning "to" or "for", and the noun "שפה" (safa), meaning "language" or "tongue". The construct state is used to indicate possession or association, so "לשפתו" can be translated as "to his language" or "for his language".

Description: "לשפתו" is a phrase that is often used to refer to someone's native language or mother tongue. It emphasizes the personal connection and ownership of the language by the individual. It can also be used more broadly to refer to any language that someone is proficient in or uses regularly.
