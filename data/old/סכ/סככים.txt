Description: In Hebrew, "סקקים" refers to "sukkahs" or "temporary shelters" that are built and used during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. A sukkah is a booth-like structure with a roof made of branches or other natural materials, and it is intended to commemorate the temporary dwellings that the Israelites lived in during their journey through the desert after the exodus from Egypt. During Sukkot, it is customary for Jewish people to eat, sleep, and spend time in the sukkah.
