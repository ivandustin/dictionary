Description: In Jewish tradition, a "סכתה" (sukkah) is a temporary hut or booth that is constructed during the festival of Sukkot. It is made of natural materials such as branches, leaves, and bamboo, and is intended to be a reminder of the temporary dwellings used by the Israelites during their journey in the desert after the exodus from Egypt. The sukkah is used for eating, sleeping, and sometimes even for living in during the week-long festival. It is a symbol of gratitude for the harvest and a time of joy and celebration.
