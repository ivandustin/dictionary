Etymology: The word "בְּתוֹכְנוֹ" (betochno) is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root ב.כ.נ (b.k.n), which means "inside" or "within." The suffix וֹ (o) indicates possession, so בְּתוֹכְנוֹ literally means "in its midst" or "in its interior."

Grammar: בְּתוֹכְנוֹ is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition בְּ (be) means "in" or "within," and תוֹכְנוֹ (tochno) is a noun that means "its midst" or "its interior." The phrase is used to indicate that something is located or contained within something else.

Description: בְּתוֹכְנוֹ is often used in Hebrew to describe something that is inside or within a specific object or place. It can be used to refer to physical objects, such as "בְּתוֹכְנוֹ שֶׁל הבַּיִת" (betochno shel habayit) meaning "inside the house," or it can be used metaphorically to describe abstract concepts, such as "בְּתוֹכְנוֹ שֶׁל הדָּבָר" (betochno shel hadavar) meaning "within the matter" or "in the context of the issue."
