Etymology: The word "בְּתוֹכַנָּה" (betochanah) is a Hebrew word that is composed of two parts. The first part, "בְּתוֹך" (betoch), means "inside" or "within." The second part, "נָּה" (nah), is a suffix that indicates a state or condition. Therefore, "בְּתוֹכַנָּה" can be translated as "inwardness" or "inner state."

Grammar: "בְּתוֹכַנָּה" is a noun in the feminine singular form. It is derived from the root ב.ו.כ (b.w.k), which means "inside" or "within." The suffix נָּה (nah) is added to indicate a state or condition.

Description: "בְּתוֹכַנָּה" is used to describe the inner state or condition of something or someone. It refers to the thoughts, feelings, or attitudes that exist within a person or a group. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the essence or core of something.
