Etymology: The word "בתחלאים" (betachla'im) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root "ת.ח.ל" (T.C.L), which means "to begin" or "to start." The prefix "ב" (bet) means "in" or "at," and the suffix "ים" (im) indicates a plural form. Therefore, "בתחלאים" can be translated as "in the beginnings" or "at the start."

Grammar: "בתחלאים" is a masculine plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "ים" (im) to the singular form "בתחלה" (betachla). In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they must agree with other words in a sentence.

Description: "בתחלאים" is used to describe the initial stages or beginnings of something. It can refer to the early stages of a process, a project, or an event. It implies the starting point or the first steps taken in a particular situation.
