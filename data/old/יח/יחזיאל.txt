Etymology: The word "יחזיאל" (Yechizael) is a Hebrew name derived from the combination of two elements. The first element, "יחז" (Yechaz), is a shortened form of the Hebrew verb "יחזה" (yachazeh), which means "to see" or "to behold." The second element, "אל" (El), is a common Hebrew suffix that means "God." Therefore, the name "יחזיאל" can be translated as "God sees" or "God beholds."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "יחזיאל" is a masculine proper noun. It follows the pattern of many Hebrew names, consisting of a root word or verb and a suffix that indicates a connection to God. The name can be used as a given name for boys or as a surname.
