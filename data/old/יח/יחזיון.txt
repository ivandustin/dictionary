Grammar: "יחזיון" is a masculine noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word can be modified to match different grammatical cases, such as יחזיונות (Yechizyonot) in the plural form.

Description: "יחזיון" refers to a vision or a prophecy. It is often used in religious or spiritual contexts to describe a divine revelation or a glimpse into the future. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe a vivid imagination or a strong mental image.
