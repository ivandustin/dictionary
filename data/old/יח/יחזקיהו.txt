Etymology: The word "יחזקיהו" (Yechizkiyahu) is a Hebrew name derived from the combination of two elements. The first element, "יחזק" (Yechizk), is derived from the Hebrew verb "חזק" (chazak), which means "to be strong" or "to strengthen." The second element, "יהו" (Yahu), is a shortened form of the Hebrew name for God, "יהוה" (Yahweh). Therefore, the name "יחזקיהו" can be translated as "God strengthens" or "Yahweh is my strength."

Grammar: "יחזקיהו" is a masculine Hebrew name. In Hebrew, names are often formed by combining words or elements with specific meanings. The name "יחזקיהו" follows this pattern, combining the elements "יחזק" (Yechizk) and "יהו" (Yahu) to convey the meaning of strength and God.
