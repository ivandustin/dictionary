Etymology: The word "יחואל" (Yeho'el) is a Hebrew name derived from the combination of two elements: "יהו" (Yeho), which is a shortened form of the divine name of God, and "אל" (El), meaning "God" or "mighty." Therefore, the name Yeho'el can be translated as "God is mighty" or "God is his strength."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "יחואל" (Yeho'el) is a masculine proper noun. It consists of four letters: י (yod), ח (het), ו (vav), and א (aleph).

The third letter, ו (vav), is a vowel letter that can also function as a consonant. The fourth letter, א (aleph), is a silent consonant that represents a glottal stop.

Description: Yeho'el is a biblical name found in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). It is mentioned in the book of 1 Chronicles 4:35 as one of the descendants of Simeon, the son of Jacob.
