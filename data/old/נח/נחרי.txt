Etymology: The word "נחרי" (pronounced "nachri") comes from the Hebrew root נ-ח-ר, which means "foreign" or "stranger". It is derived from the noun נֵכָר (nekar), meaning "foreigner" or "alien".

Grammar: "נחרי" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being described is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: The word "נחרי" is used to describe something or someone as foreign or alien. It can refer to a person who is not from the same country or culture, or to something that is unfamiliar or different.
