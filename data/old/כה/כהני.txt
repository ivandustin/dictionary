Etymology: The word "כהני" (Kohani) comes from the Hebrew root כֹּהֵן (kohen), which means "priest" or "minister." It is derived from the Hebrew word כָּהַן (kahan), which means "to serve" or "to minister."

Grammar: "כהני" is the plural form of the word כהן (kohen), which means "priest" in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a group of priests or the priestly class in Judaism.

Description: In Judaism, the Kohanim are a hereditary priestly class descended from Aaron, the brother of Moses. They have specific religious duties and responsibilities, including performing rituals and blessings in the Temple (in ancient times) and reciting the priestly blessing during certain religious services. The Kohanim are considered to have a special status and are accorded certain privileges and restrictions within Jewish law.
