Etymology: The word "כהנים" (Kohanim) is of Hebrew origin. It comes from the Hebrew root כֹּהֵן (kohen), which means "priest" or "minister." In ancient times, the Kohanim were a hereditary priestly class in Judaism.

Grammar: "כהנים" is the plural form of the word "כהן" (kohen). In Hebrew, nouns have different forms for singular and plural. The word is masculine and is used to refer to a group of priests or the priestly class as a whole.

Description: The word "כהנים" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to the descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, who were designated as priests and had specific religious duties in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. The Kohanim played a central role in the sacrificial rituals and other religious ceremonies. Today, the term is still used to refer to individuals who are believed to be descendants of the ancient priestly class and have certain religious privileges and responsibilities in Jewish communities.
