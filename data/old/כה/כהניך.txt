Etymology: The word "כהניך" (Kohanecha) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "כהן" (Kohen), which means "priest" in English. The suffix "-יך" (-echa) is a possessive suffix that means "your" in English. Therefore, "כהניך" (Kohanecha) translates to "your priests" or "the priests belonging to you."

Grammar: "כהניך" (Kohanecha) is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "-יך" (-echa) to the singular form "כהן" (Kohen). The suffix "-יך" (-echa) indicates possession and agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies. In this case, it is used to indicate that the priests being referred to belong to the second person singular (you).

Description: "כהניך" (Kohanecha) is a term used in Hebrew to refer to the priests, specifically those who serve in the Jewish religious context.
