Etymology: The word "כהנבאי" (Kohenba'i) is a Hebrew word that combines two terms: "כהן" (Kohen) meaning "priest" and "נבאי" (Navi) meaning "prophet". It refers to a person who is both a priest and a prophet.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "כהנבאי" is a compound word formed by combining the two words "כהן" and "נבאי". The word is masculine and singular. It can be used to refer to a specific individual or to a group of individuals who possess both priestly and prophetic qualities.

Description: The term "כהנבאי" is used in Jewish religious context to describe individuals who held the dual role of being a priest and a prophet. In ancient times, priests were responsible for performing religious rituals and maintaining the sanctity of the Temple, while prophets were chosen by God to deliver divine messages and guidance to the people. The combination of these two roles in one person was considered rare and significant. The term is often used in reference to biblical figures such as Samuel and Ezekiel, who were both priests and prophets.
