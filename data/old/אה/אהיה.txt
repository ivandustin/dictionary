Etymology: The word "אהיה" (pronounced "Ehyeh") is a Hebrew word that means "I am" or "I will be." It is derived from the Hebrew verb "היה" (pronounced "hayah"), which means "to be" or "to exist."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "אהיה" is the first person singular form of the verb "היה" (to be) in the future tense. It is used to express the concept of "I will be" or "I am going to be."

Description: "אהיה" is a significant word in Hebrew, particularly in religious and spiritual contexts. It is often associated with the divine name of God, as it is used in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 3:14) when God reveals His name to Moses: "אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה" (pronounced "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh"), which can be translated as "I am who I am" or "I will be what I will be." This phrase signifies God's eternal existence and His self-sufficiency.
