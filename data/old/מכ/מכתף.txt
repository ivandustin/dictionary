Etymology: The word "מכתף" (maktéf) comes from the Hebrew root כ.ת.ף (k.t.f), which means "to shoulder" or "to bear a burden". 

Grammar: In Hebrew, "מכתף" is a noun that is used to refer to the shoulder, the part of the body that connects the arm to the torso. It can also be used metaphorically to describe carrying a burden or responsibility.

Description: The shoulder is an important part of the human body, providing support and mobility to the arm. It is a joint that allows for a wide range of movements, such as lifting, reaching, and throwing. The shoulder is made up of several bones, including the clavicle (collarbone), scapula (shoulder blade), and humerus (upper arm bone). It is also surrounded by muscles, tendons, and ligaments that help stabilize and move the joint.
