Etymology: The word "מכנרת" (Maknaret) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כ-נ-ר (k-n-r), which means "to dig" or "to excavate." It is derived from the noun כְּנֵרָה (k'narah), which means "harp" or "lyre." The connection between digging and the musical instrument is not entirely clear, but it is believed that the harp was made by hollowing out a piece of wood, hence the association with digging.

Grammar: "מכנרת" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in northern Israel. In Hebrew, nouns have gender, and the feminine form is used for bodies of water. The word can also be used metaphorically to refer to any large body of water.
