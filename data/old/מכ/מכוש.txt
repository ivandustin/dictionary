Description: "מכוש" (makhosh) refers to a crushing instrument or a millstone used for grinding grains or other materials. In ancient times, it was a common tool used for grinding wheat, barley, and other grains to produce flour. The millstone consists of two circular stones, one on top of the other, with the grain being crushed between them. This process was typically done by hand or with the help of animals, such as donkeys or oxen, which would rotate the upper stone. The resulting flour was then used for baking bread and other food items.
