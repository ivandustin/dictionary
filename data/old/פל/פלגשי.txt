Etymology: The word "פלגשי" (pronounced "pilegesh") is a Hebrew term that originated from the Hebrew Bible. It is derived from the root word "פלגש" which means "concubine" or "secondary wife". 

Grammar: "פלגשי" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is the plural form of "פלגש" and refers to multiple concubines or secondary wives. 

Description: In ancient times, a concubine or secondary wife, referred to as "פלגשי", was a woman who had a lower status than the primary wife in a polygamous marriage. While the primary wife had legal and social rights, the concubine had a more limited status and was often considered as a secondary partner. The practice of having concubines was common in many ancient cultures, including ancient Israel. However, it is important to note that the concept of concubines is not widely practiced or accepted in modern times.
