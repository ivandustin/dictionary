Etymology: The word "לקולי" comes from the Hebrew language. It is a combination of the preposition "ל" (meaning "to" or "for") and the noun "קול" (meaning "voice"). 

Grammar: "לקולי" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" indicates direction or purpose, and it is followed by the noun "קול" in the construct state. The construct state is used to show a possessive relationship between two nouns, where the first noun modifies the second noun. In this case, "קול" (voice) is modified by "ל" (to/for).

Description: "לקולי" can be translated as "to my voice" or "for my voice" in English. It is used to express ownership or possession of a voice, indicating that something is done or intended for the speaker's voice.
