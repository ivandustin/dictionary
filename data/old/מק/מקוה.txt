Description: A mikveh is a Jewish ritual bath used for the purpose of purification. It is typically used for immersion in water to achieve a state of ritual purity. The concept of the mikveh is rooted in Jewish law and is an important part of Jewish religious practice. It is used for various purposes, including conversion to Judaism, purification after menstruation or childbirth, and preparation for certain religious rituals. The water in a mikveh must come from a natural source, such as rainwater or a spring, and must be in a sufficient quantity to allow for complete immersion.
