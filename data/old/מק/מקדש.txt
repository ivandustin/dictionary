Description: "מקדש" (Mikdash) refers to a sanctuary or a holy place in Judaism. It is most commonly used to describe the ancient Jewish temples in Jerusalem, such as the First Temple (built by King Solomon) and the Second Temple (rebuilt after the Babylonian exile). These temples were considered the central places of worship and sacrifice for the Jewish people. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to any sacred or holy place.
