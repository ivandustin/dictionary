Etymology: The word "מקוא" (pronounced "ma-kor") comes from the Hebrew root ק.ו.א (q.w.a), which means "to gather" or "to collect." It is derived from the noun קָוֶה (ka-veh), which means "a gathering" or "a collection."

Grammar: "מקוא" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is singular and can be used in both the definite and indefinite forms. In the plural form, it becomes "מקוואות" (mik-va-ot).

Description: "מקוא" refers to a ritual bath used in Jewish tradition for the purpose of purification. It is typically used by individuals who want to cleanse themselves spiritually, such as before certain religious ceremonies or after menstruation. The mikveh is filled with natural water, such as rainwater or spring water, and must meet specific requirements to be considered valid for use.
