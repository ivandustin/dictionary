Etymology: The word "מקרוב" (pronounced "mekarov" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root ק.ר.ב (k.r.b), which means "to be close" or "to approach." The prefix מ (me) indicates "from" or "out of," so מקרוב literally means "from close" or "from nearby."

Grammar: מקרוב is an adverb in Hebrew. It is used to describe something that is close in proximity or time. It can be translated as "closely," "nearby," or "soon."
