Etymology: The word "מְקוֹלָם" (pronounced "mekolam") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ק.ו.ל (k.w.l), which means "to voice" or "to sound." The prefix מְ (me-) indicates the passive form, so מְקוֹלָם can be translated as "voiced" or "sounded."

Grammar: מְקוֹלָם is a noun in the singular masculine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The masculine form is used when referring to a male or a group of mixed gender.

Description: מְקוֹלָם is used to describe something that is voiced or sounded. It can refer to a vocalized sound, such as a spoken word or a musical note. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the expression or communication of ideas or emotions.
