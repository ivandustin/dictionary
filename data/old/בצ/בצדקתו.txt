Etymology: The word "בְּצִדְקָתוֹ" (betzidkato) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צדק (tz-d-k), which means "justice" or "righteousness." The suffix תוֹ (-to) indicates possession, so the word can be translated as "in his righteousness" or "by his righteousness."

Grammar: "בְּצִדְקָתוֹ" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition בְּ (be) means "in" or "by," and צִדְקָתוֹ (tzidkato) is a noun that means "his righteousness." The word צִדְקָה (tzidkah) is a feminine noun, but in this case, it is modified to agree with a masculine noun, hence the suffix תוֹ (-to).

Description: The phrase "בְּצִדְקָתוֹ" is often used in Hebrew to express the concept of relying on or being justified by someone's righteousness. It can be found in religious texts and prayers, emphasizing the belief in divine justice and righteousness.
