Etymology: The word "נצרי" (pronounced "Netzri") comes from the Hebrew root נ-צ-ר (n-tz-r), which means "to watch" or "to guard." It is derived from the noun נֵצֶר (nezer), meaning "a branch" or "a shoot." In the context of the word "נצרי," it refers to someone who follows or belongs to the branch of Judaism known as "Nazarene."

Grammar: "נצרי" is a Hebrew adjective that is used to describe someone or something related to Nazareth or the Nazarene sect of Judaism. In Hebrew grammar, adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Therefore, the form of "נצרי" can change depending on the gender and number of the noun it modifies.

Description: The term "נצרי" is primarily used to refer to Jesus of Nazareth in Hebrew. It is the Hebrew equivalent of the English word "Nazarene." In the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus is often referred to as "נצרי" to indicate his association with the town of Nazareth. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to Christians or followers of the Nazarene sect.
