Etymology: The word "ידעתם" (pronounced "yeda'tem") is a Hebrew word. It is derived from the root י-ד-ע (y-d-a), which means "to know" or "to be aware of". The suffix תם (-tem) indicates the second person plural, so ידעתם means "you (plural) knew" or "you (plural) were aware".

Grammar: ידעתם is a verb form in the past tense, second person plural, masculine gender. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the subject, tense, and gender. The root י-ד-ע remains the same, but the suffixes and prefixes change to indicate the specific grammatical features.
