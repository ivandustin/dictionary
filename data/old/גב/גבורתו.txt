Etymology: The word "גבורתו" (pronounced "g'vurato") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ג-ב-ר, which means "to be strong" or "to prevail." The suffix תו (-to) indicates the possessive form, so גבורתו means "his strength" or "his might."

Grammar: גבורתו is a noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender, and גבורתו is masculine. It is also in the construct state, which means it is used to indicate possession or association. The suffix תו (-to) is added to the root גבורה (g'vurah) to indicate possession.

Description: גבורתו is used to describe the strength or might of a male subject. It can refer to physical strength, as well as inner strength, courage, or power. It is often used in a figurative sense to describe someone's heroic or admirable qualities.
