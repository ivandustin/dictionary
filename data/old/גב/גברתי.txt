Etymology: The word "גברתי" (pronounced "givarti") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ג-ב-ר (g-b-r), which means "to be strong" or "to prevail." The suffix ת-י (-ti) indicates the first person singular possessive form, so גברתי means "my strength" or "my power."

Grammar: גברתי is a noun in the feminine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The feminine form is used when referring to a female subject or when the noun itself is inherently feminine. The singular form indicates that there is only one instance of the noun.

Description: גברתי is a word that describes personal strength or power. It can be used to express physical strength, mental fortitude, or influence. It is often used in a figurative sense to convey a sense of empowerment or determination.
