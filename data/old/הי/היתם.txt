Etymology: The word "היתם" (pronounced "haytam") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ה.י.ת (h.y.t), which means "to be" or "to exist" in the past tense. The suffix ם (-m) indicates the plural form of the verb, so "היתם" translates to "you (plural) were" or "you (plural) existed."

Grammar: "היתם" is the second person plural masculine past tense form of the verb "to be" in Hebrew. It is used to address a group of people who are all male or a mixed group of males and females. In the present tense, the word would be "אתם" (atem), which means "you (plural) are."

Description: "היתם" is a word used to refer to a group of people who were present or existed in the past. It is commonly used in storytelling, historical accounts, or when talking about a group of people who no longer exist or are no longer present.
