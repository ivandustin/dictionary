Etymology: The word "היקרה" (HaYikra) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "קרא" (kara), which means "to call" or "to read". The prefix "ה" (ha) in Hebrew is used to indicate "the" or "this". Therefore, "היקרה" can be translated as "the calling" or "the reading".

Grammar: "היקרה" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a specific calling or reading, often in a formal or ceremonial context. In Hebrew grammar, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can be modified by definite articles (like "ה" in this case) to indicate specificity.

Description: "היקרה" is a word that is often used in Jewish religious contexts to refer to the reading of the Torah, the sacred text of Judaism. It can also be used more broadly to refer to any formal or ceremonial reading or calling. The word carries a sense of importance and reverence, as it is associated with the act of engaging with sacred or significant texts.
