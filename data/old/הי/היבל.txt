Etymology: The word "היבל" (Hevel) comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root ה-ב-ל (H-B-L), which means "to breathe" or "to be vain." 

Grammar: "היבל" (Hevel) is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe something that is fleeting, transient, or meaningless. It is often used metaphorically to refer to the brevity and insignificance of human life or worldly possessions.

Description: In Jewish and biblical literature, "היבל" (Hevel) is famously known as the name of Abel, the son of Adam and Eve. Hevel is known for offering a more acceptable sacrifice to God than his brother Cain, which led to Cain's jealousy and ultimately to Abel's murder. The story of Cain and Abel serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of envy and the fleeting nature of worldly achievements.
