Etymology: The word "היכלא" (pronounced "heekh-lah") is a Hebrew word that means "temple" or "sanctuary". It is derived from the Hebrew root word "ה.כ.ל" (pronounced "h.k.l"), which means "to contain" or "to hold".

Grammar: In Hebrew, "היכלא" is a noun that is typically used in the masculine singular form. It can be modified by definite articles or possessive pronouns to indicate specific temples or sanctuaries.

Description: "היכלא" refers to a place of worship or a sacred building in Jewish tradition. It is often used to describe the ancient temples in Jerusalem, such as the First Temple (built by King Solomon) and the Second Temple (rebuilt after the Babylonian exile). These temples were central to Jewish religious and cultural life, serving as the focal point for communal worship, sacrifices, and other religious rituals. Today, the term "היכלא" can also be used more broadly to refer to any synagogue or place of worship in the Jewish community.
