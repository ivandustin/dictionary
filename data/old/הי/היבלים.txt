Grammar: "היבלים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ים" (-im) to the singular form "היבל" (ha'avel). In Hebrew, nouns have gender, and "היבלים" is masculine.

Description: "היבלים" is often translated as "vanities" or "vanities of vanities" in English. It refers to things that are fleeting, temporary, or ultimately meaningless. In the book of Ecclesiastes, the term is used to describe the futility of pursuing worldly pleasures and possessions, and the importance of seeking meaning and purpose in life.
