Etymology: The word "בבץ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב.ב.ץ (bet-bet-tsade). It is derived from the Aramaic word "בַּבְּצָא" (bavtsa), which means "to break" or "to shatter."

Grammar: "בבץ" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe a specific type of clothing. It is a short, sleeveless garment that was worn by priests in ancient times. It is also known as an ephod.

Description: The "בבץ" was a significant part of the priestly attire in ancient Israel. It was made of fine linen and was adorned with precious stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The high priest would wear a more elaborate version of the "בבץ" that included additional decorations and a breastplate with twelve gemstones.

The "בבץ" was worn over a longer tunic and was fastened with shoulder straps. It covered the upper body and extended down to the waist. The purpose of the "בבץ" was to distinguish the priests and to symbolize their role as intermediaries between God and the people.

In addition to its religious significance, the "בבץ" also had a practical function. It provided support for the breastplate and helped distribute its weight evenly. The breastplate contained the Urim and Thummim, which were used for divination and seeking guidance from God.

Today, the "בבץ" is not commonly worn, as the priestly duties and rituals of ancient Israel are no longer practiced in the same way. However, it remains an important symbol in Jewish history and is often depicted in religious art and literature.
