Etymology: The word "בבניך" (pronounced "b'vanecha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בנה (pronounced "bana"), which means "to build" or "to construct." The word בבניך is a combination of the preposition ב (pronounced "b") meaning "in" or "with," and the plural form of the noun בן (pronounced "ben") meaning "son." Therefore, the literal translation of בבניך is "in your sons" or "with your sons."

Grammar: בבניך is a possessive noun phrase in Hebrew. It consists of the preposition ב (in or with) and the plural form of the noun בן (son). The suffix יך (pronounced "echa") indicates possession, meaning "your." The plural form of בן is בנים (pronounced "banim"), but in this case, it is בניך to match the possessive pronoun.

Description: בבניך is used in the Hebrew Bible and has various meanings depending on the context. It can refer to "your sons" in a literal sense, or it can be used metaphorically to represent future generations or descendants. It is often used to emphasize the continuity and legacy of a person or a nation.
