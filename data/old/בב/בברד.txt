Etymology: The word "בברד" (babard) is derived from the Hebrew root ב.ר.ד (b.r.d), which means "to hail" or "to rain down." 

Grammar: "בברד" (babard) is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the singular form and is masculine.

Description: "בברד" (babard) refers to hail, which is a form of solid precipitation that consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice. Hailstones are formed when there are strong updrafts in thunderstorms, which carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere where they freeze. These frozen raindrops then grow in size as they are repeatedly carried upward and downward by the storm's updrafts and downdrafts. Eventually, the hailstones become too heavy for the updrafts to support, and they fall to the ground. Hail can cause damage to crops, vehicles, and buildings, depending on its size and intensity.
