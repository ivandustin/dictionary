Etymology: The word "עפרים" (pronounced "afarim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עפר (pronounced "afar"), which means "dust" or "earth". The suffix ים (pronounced "im") is a plural form, so עפרים literally means "dusts" or "earths".

Grammar: עפרים is a masculine plural noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to multiple instances of dust or earth. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also have different forms depending on their function in a sentence (e.g., subject, object, possessive).

Description: עפרים is a versatile word that can be used in various contexts. It can refer to literal dust or earth, such as the particles that settle on surfaces or the soil on the ground.
