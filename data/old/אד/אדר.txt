Grammar: In Hebrew, "אדר" is a noun that is commonly used to refer to the month of Adar in the Hebrew calendar. It can also be used as a proper name for individuals.

Description: Adar is the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar, which usually falls in February or March in the Gregorian calendar. It is known as a month of joy and celebration in Jewish tradition, particularly because it is the month in which the holiday of Purim is celebrated.
