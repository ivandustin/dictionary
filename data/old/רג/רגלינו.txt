Etymology: The word "רגלינו" comes from the Hebrew language. It is a combination of the word "רגל" (regel), meaning "leg" or "foot," and the suffix "-ינו" (-inu), which indicates possession or belonging. Therefore, "רגלינו" translates to "our legs" or "our feet" in English.

Grammar: "רגלינו" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ינו" to the singular noun "רגל." The suffix "-ינו" indicates possession by the first-person plural pronoun "we" (נו). In Hebrew, nouns and their possessors agree in number and gender.

Description: "רגלינו" refers to the legs or feet of a group of people. It can be used to describe the physical body parts or to indicate possession or ownership. For example, "אנחנו הולכים על רגלינו" (anachnu holechim al regelenu) means "we are walking on our feet."
