Etymology: The word "בלשוני" (belshoni) is derived from the Hebrew root "לשון" (lashon), which means "tongue" or "language." The prefix "ב" (be) indicates "in" or "with," so "בלשוני" can be translated as "linguistic" or "in terms of language."

Grammar: "בלשוני" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. For example, "בלשוני" can be used to describe a masculine singular noun like "ספר" (sefer), meaning "book," as "ספר בלשוני" (sefer belshoni), which translates to "linguistic book."

Description: "בלשוני" is used to describe something that is related to language or linguistics. It can refer to the study of languages, the structure and rules of a particular language, or anything pertaining to language in general.
