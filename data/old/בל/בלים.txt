Description: "בלים" (belim) refers to ruminant animals, which have a unique digestive system that allows them to chew their food, swallow it, and then regurgitate it to chew it again. This process, known as rumination, helps these animals break down tough plant materials and extract nutrients from them. Ruminant animals are important in agriculture and provide a significant source of meat and dairy products.
