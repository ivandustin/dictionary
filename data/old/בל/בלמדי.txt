Etymology: The word "בלמדי" comes from the Hebrew root "ל.מ.ד" (l.m.d), which means "to learn" or "to study". The prefix "ב" (b) means "in" or "with". Therefore, "בלמדי" can be translated as "in my learning" or "with my study".

Grammar: "בלמדי" is a first-person singular possessive form of the noun "לימוד" (limud), which means "study" or "learning". The suffix "-י" (-i) indicates possession, so "בלמדי" means "my study" or "my learning".

Description: "בלמדי" is a Hebrew phrase that expresses ownership or possession of the act of learning or studying. It can be used to indicate that the speaker is engaged in personal study or learning.
