Etymology: The word "כאפר" (pronounced "ka'fer") comes from the Hebrew root כ-פ-ר, which means "to cover" or "to atone." It is related to the Hebrew word כִּפֻּר (kipur), which means "atonement" or "forgiveness."

Grammar: "כאפר" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the singular form and is masculine. In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, and they can also be declined to indicate possession or other grammatical features.

Description: "כאפר" is a term used in Jewish religious and cultural contexts. It refers to a person who is hired to say the Kaddish prayer on behalf of a deceased individual. The Kaddish is a prayer recited in Aramaic and is traditionally said by mourners during the mourning period after the death of a close relative. However, if there are no close relatives available to say the Kaddish, a כאפר can be hired to fulfill this role. The כאפר is usually paid for their services and is often someone who is knowledgeable in Jewish customs and prayers.
