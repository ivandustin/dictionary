Etymology: The word "וְתִימְנָה" (vetimnah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root תמן (t-m-n), which means "to hide" or "to conceal." It is derived from the noun תֵּמֶן (temen), which means "south" or "the right hand side." In ancient times, the south was considered a hidden or concealed direction, hence the connection between the root תמן and the concept of hiding.

Grammar: "וְתִימְנָה" is a feminine plural noun in Hebrew. The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the root תמן (t-m-n) is conjugated in the third person feminine plural form. The suffix נָה (nah) indicates the plural feminine gender.

Description: "וְתִימְנָה" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the south or the southern region. It can also be used metaphorically to mean "the right hand side" or "the hidden side." In some contexts, it can represent a place of blessing or favor.
