Etymology: The word "וְתַכְסֵהוּ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כסה (k-s-h), which means "to cover" or "to conceal." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the suffix הוּ (hu) is a third-person masculine singular pronoun, meaning "him." Therefore, the word וְתַכְסֵהוּ can be translated as "and you shall cover him."

Grammar: וְתַכְסֵהוּ is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the future tense and the second-person masculine singular form. The prefix וְ (vav) indicates the future tense, and the root כסה (k-s-h) is conjugated in the second-person masculine singular form. The suffix הוּ (hu) is added to indicate the object of the verb, which in this case is "him."

Description: וְתַכְסֵהוּ is a command form in Hebrew, specifically the imperative form. It is found in the Bible, in the book of Exodus (Exodus 25:20), where it is part of the instructions for building the Ark of the Covenant. The phrase וְתַכְסֵהוּ is translated as "and you shall cover him" and refers to covering the Ark with a golden cover, known as the "kapporet" or "mercy seat." This command emphasizes the importance of protecting and concealing the Ark, which was considered a sacred object in ancient Israelite religious practices.
