Etymology: The word "וְתַשׁוּעַתִי" is a Hebrew word derived from the root שׁ.וּ.ע (sh.u.a), which means "to save" or "to deliver." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix תַּשּׁוּעַתִי (tashu'ati) is the first person singular possessive form of the noun תְּשׁוּעָה (teshu'ah), meaning "salvation" or "deliverance."

Grammar: The word "וְתַשׁוּעַתִי" is a noun phrase composed of the conjunction וְ (ve) and the noun תַּשּׁוּעַתִי (tashu'ati). In Hebrew, nouns can be modified by possessive suffixes to indicate possession or attribution. In this case, the possessive suffix תִי (ti) is added to the noun תְּשׁוּעָה (teshu'ah) to indicate "my salvation" or "my deliverance."

Description: The word "וְתַשׁוּעַתִי" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to personal salvation or deliverance. It signifies the act of being saved or rescued from danger or distress. The possessive form indicates that the salvation or deliverance is attributed to the speaker, emphasizing a personal connection to the act of being saved.
