Description: "וְתַרְאֵנָה" is a biblical Hebrew word that appears in the Book of Exodus (Exodus 3:3). It is part of the dialogue between Moses and God at the burning bush. In this verse, God instructs Moses to go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses asks God what he should say if the Israelites ask for God's name. God responds, "אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה" (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh), which can be translated as "I am who I am." God then tells Moses to say to the Israelites, "אֶהְיֶה שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶם" (Ehyeh Shlachani Aleichem), which can be translated as "I am has sent me to you." In response to Moses' question about the Israelites' reaction, God says, "וְתַרְאֵנָה אֵלֶיךָ" (VeTar'ena Eilecha), which can be translated as "and they will see you."
