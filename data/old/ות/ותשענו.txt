Etymology: The word "וְתֵשְׁעֵנוּ" (v'tesh'enu) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "וְ" (v') which means "and" and "תֵּשְׁעֵנוּ" (tesh'enu) which is the plural form of the word "תֵּשַׁע" (tesha) meaning "nine". Therefore, "וְתֵּשְׁעֵנוּ" (v'tesh'enu) translates to "and nine of us".

Grammar: "וְתֵּשְׁעֵנוּ" (v'tesh'enu) is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is a conjugation of the verb "לִתְשֹׁעַ" (lit'shoa) which means "to save" or "to rescue". The prefix "וְ" (v') indicates the conjunction "and", and the suffix "נוּ" (nu) indicates the first person plural pronoun "us". Therefore, "וְתֵּשְׁעֵנוּ" (v'tesh'enu) can be translated as "and save us" or "and rescue us".
