Etymology: The word "וְתֵשְׁתָּהוּ" (v'toshetahu) is a Hebrew word that appears in the Bible, specifically in the book of Genesis. It is derived from the root שׁ.ו.ה (sh.w.h), which means "to be desolate" or "to be empty."

Grammar: "וְתֵשְׁתָּהוּ" is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It is in the imperfect tense, which indicates an ongoing or incomplete action. The prefix וְ (v') means "and," and the root ת.שְׁ.תָּ.ה.וּ (t.sh.t.h.u) is conjugated to match the third person singular masculine subject.

Description: In the book of Genesis, the phrase "וְתֵשְׁתָּהוּ וָבֹהוּ" (v'toshetahu vavohu) is used to describe the state of the earth before God's creation. It is often translated as "formless and empty" or "void and without form." This phrase is used to depict a chaotic and uninhabitable state of the earth before God's creative work.
