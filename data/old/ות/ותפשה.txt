Etymology: The word "וְתַפְשֵׁהָ" (v'tafsheha) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פ-ש-ה (p-sh-h), which means "to spread out" or "to extend." The prefix וְ (v') means "and," and the word תַּפְשֵׁהָ (taf-she-ha) is the feminine singular form of the verb.

Grammar: In Hebrew, וְתַפְשֵׁהָ is a verb in the future tense, which means "and she will spread out" or "and she will extend." The prefix וְ (v') indicates the conjunction "and," and the root פ-ש-ה (p-sh-h) is conjugated in the future tense to match the third person feminine singular subject.

It can also be used metaphorically to describe the expansion or increase of something, such as knowledge, influence, or territory.
