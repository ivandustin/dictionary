Etymology: The word "חשם" (pronounced "chashem") comes from the Hebrew root ח-ש-ם, which means "to seal" or "to stamp." It is derived from the ancient Semitic word "חתם" (pronounced "chatam"), which has a similar meaning.

Grammar: "חשם" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe a seal or a stamp. It can also refer to the act of sealing or stamping something.

Description: In ancient times, seals were used to authenticate documents or to mark ownership. They were typically made of clay, stone, or metal and were engraved with a unique design or inscription. The seal would be pressed onto a document or object, leaving an impression that served as a mark of authenticity or ownership. The act of sealing was considered significant and binding.

In modern Hebrew, the word "חשם" is still used to refer to a seal or a stamp, but it can also be used metaphorically to describe something that is considered final, authoritative, or unchangeable. For example, the phrase "חותם חשם" (pronounced "chotem chashem") means "officially sealed" or "signed and sealed."
