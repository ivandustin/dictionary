Etymology: The word "וּבְרֵאשִׁית" (u'v'reishit) is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "and in the beginning" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root ב-ר-א (b-r-a), which means "to create" or "to shape."

Grammar: "וּבְרֵאשִׁית" is composed of two parts: the conjunction "וּ" (u) meaning "and," and the noun phrase "בְּרֵאשִׁית" (b'reishit) meaning "in the beginning." In Hebrew, the word order is often reversed compared to English, so "and in the beginning" is the literal translation.

Description: "וּבְרֵאשִׁית" is the opening phrase of the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Book of Genesis. It introduces the creation story and sets the stage for the narrative that follows. The phrase signifies the beginning of time and the start of the world's existence according to the biblical account.
