Etymology: The word "וִבְרֵאשִׁית" (pronounced "v'bereshit") is a Hebrew word that translates to "and the beginning" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root בָּרָא (bara), which means "to create" or "to make."

Grammar: "וִבְרֵאשִׁית" is a compound word composed of two elements: "וְ" (pronounced "v'") which means "and" and "בְּרֵאשִׁית" (pronounced "bereshit") which means "the beginning." In Hebrew, the word order is often reversed compared to English, so "and the beginning" is translated as "וִבְרֵאשִׁית."
