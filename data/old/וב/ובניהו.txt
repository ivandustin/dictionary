Etymology: The word "וּבְנִיהוּ" (uveniyahu) is a Hebrew name composed of two elements. "וּ" (u) means "and" in Hebrew, and "בְּנִיהוּ" (veniyahu) is a combination of two words: "בֵּן" (ben) meaning "son" and "יָהוּ" (yahu) which is a shortened form of the divine name "יהוה" (Yahweh). Therefore, "וּבְנִיהוּ" (uveniyahu) can be translated as "and the son of Yahweh" or "and Yahweh's son."

Grammar: "וּבְנִיהוּ" (uveniyahu) is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "וּ" (u) is a conjunction meaning "and," and "בְּנִיהוּ" (veniyahu) is a noun meaning "son of Yahweh." In Hebrew, nouns are inflected for gender, number, and case, but "וּבְנִיהוּ" (uveniyahu) remains unchanged in this form.

Description: "וּבְנִיהוּ" (uveniyahu) is a biblical name found in the Hebrew Bible.

The name "וּבְנִיהוּ" (uveniyahu) carries religious significance, as it includes the divine name "Yahweh" and implies a special relationship with God.
