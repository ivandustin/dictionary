Etymology: The word "וְבָאֳנִיוֹת" (pronounced "ve-vanayot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב.א.נ (B.A.N), which means "to build" or "to construct." The word is derived from the verb בָּנָה (banah), which means "to build" or "to construct."

Grammar: "וְבָאֳנִיוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the prefix וְ (ve-) to the singular noun אֳנִיָּה (oniya), which means "ship" or "boat." The prefix וְ (ve-) indicates the conjunction "and" in Hebrew, so the word "וְבָאֳנִיוֹת" translates to "and ships" or "and boats."

Description: "וְבָאֳנִיוֹת" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to ships or boats. It appears in various contexts, such as the ships of King Solomon that were used for trade and exploration. The word can also be used metaphorically to represent any type of vessel or vehicle used for transportation or travel.
