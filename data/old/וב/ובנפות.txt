Etymology: The word "וּבְנֻפוֹת" (pronounced "uvenufot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בנפת (BNPT), which means "to fly" or "to soar." It is derived from the noun נְפִיפִים (nefifim), which means "wings."

Grammar: "וּבְנֻפוֹת" is a plural noun in the Hebrew language. It is formed by adding the prefix וּ (u) to the root נפת (nufat) and the plural suffix וֹת (ot). The prefix וּ (u) indicates "and" or "with," and the plural suffix וֹת (ot) is used to indicate multiple objects or entities.

Description: "וּבְנֻפוֹת" refers to "wings" in Hebrew. It is used to describe the anatomical structures that enable birds, insects, and some other animals to fly. Wings are typically composed of feathers or membranes stretched over a framework of bones. They play a crucial role in the locomotion and maneuverability of flying creatures.
