Description: "וַבְשֵׁבְתוֹת" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to the temporary dwellings or booths that the Israelites were commanded to live in during the festival of Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles). These booths were constructed using natural materials such as branches, leaves, and fruits, and they served as a reminder of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt. The festival of Sukkot is still celebrated by Jewish communities today, and it involves the building and dwelling in sukkot (plural of sukkah) for seven days.
