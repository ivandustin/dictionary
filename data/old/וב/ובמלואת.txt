Etymology: The word "וּבְמִלּוֹאֵי־תַקְנוּן" is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "וּבְ" meaning "and" and "מִלּוֹאֵי־תַקְנוּן" meaning "fillers of the prayer." 

Grammar: "וּבְ" is a conjunction meaning "and" in Hebrew. "מִלּוֹאֵי־תַקְנוּן" is a noun phrase composed of the noun "מִלּוֹאֵי" meaning "fillers" and the noun "תַקְנוּן" meaning "prayer." The phrase is used to refer to certain prayers or blessings that are recited before or after the main prayer.

Description: "וּבְמִלּוֹאֵי־תַקְנוּן" is a term used in Jewish liturgy to describe additional prayers or blessings that are inserted into the regular prayer service. These fillers are often recited before or after the main prayer and can vary depending on the specific prayer service or occasion. They may include prayers for personal needs, communal concerns, or special occasions. The purpose of these fillers is to enhance the prayer experience and provide an opportunity for additional spiritual connection.
