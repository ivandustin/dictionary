Etymology: The word "וּבְכִסְפִּי" (pronounced "u'v'chispi") is a Hebrew phrase that translates to "and with my money" in English. It is composed of the conjunction "וּ" (pronounced "u"), meaning "and," the preposition "בְ" (pronounced "b'"), meaning "with," and the noun "כֶּסֶף" (pronounced "kesef"), meaning "money."
