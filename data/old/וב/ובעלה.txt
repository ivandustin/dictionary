Etymology: The word "וּבְעָלָה" (u've'alah) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. "וּ" (u) is a conjunction meaning "and," and "בְעָלָה" (ve'alah) is a noun derived from the root בָּעַל (ba'al), which means "to possess" or "to own."

Grammar: "וּבְעָלָה" (u've'alah) is a compound word formed by combining the conjunction "וּ" (u) with the noun "בְעָלָה" (ve'alah). In Hebrew, the conjunction "וּ" (u) is used to connect words or phrases, and the noun "בְעָלָה" (ve'alah) means "mistress" or "wife."

Description: "וּבְעָלָה" (u've'alah) is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a woman who is married. It is often used in the context of discussing the rights and responsibilities of a husband and wife in a marriage. In traditional Jewish law, a husband is considered the "ba'al" (owner) of his wife, and she is referred to as his "עֶבֶד" (eved) or "שִׁפְחָה" (shifcha), meaning "servant" or "maid." However, in modern times, the term "וּבְעָלָה" (u've'alah) is often used to emphasize the equal partnership and mutual respect between spouses in a marriage.
