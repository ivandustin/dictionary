Description: The word וּבְחֵשֶׁן (u'vechesen) refers to a specific object mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 28:15-30). It is a breastplate worn by the High Priest of Israel as part of his ceremonial attire. The breastplate was made of gold and set with twelve precious stones, each representing one of the twelve tribes of Israel. It was worn over the ephod, a garment worn by the High Priest, and contained the Urim and Thummim, which were used for divination or seeking guidance from God. The breastplate was an important symbol of the High Priest's role as a mediator between God and the people of Israel.
