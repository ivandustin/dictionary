Etymology: The word "וּבְתֵמִים" (pronounced "u'v'teemim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב.ת.מ (B.T.M), which means "complete" or "perfect." It is derived from the noun תָּמִים (tamim), which means "complete" or "whole."

Grammar: "וּבְתֵמִים" is a phrase composed of two parts: the conjunction וּ (u), meaning "and," and the adjective בְּתֵמִים (b'teemim), meaning "perfect" or "blameless." In Hebrew grammar, adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is masculine singular, the adjective will also be masculine singular.

Description: The phrase "וּבְתֵמִים" is used in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in Genesis 6:9, to describe Noah. It signifies that Noah was a righteous and blameless man in his generation. The word emphasizes his moral integrity and his adherence to God's commandments.
