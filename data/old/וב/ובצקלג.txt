Etymology: The word "וּבְצַקְלֶג" (pronounced "u'vatzal'eg") is a Hebrew word that appears in the Bible. It is derived from the root צָלַג (tsalag), which means "to leap" or "to jump."

Grammar: "וּבְצַקְלֶג" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is written with the conjunction "וּ" (u), which means "and," followed by the noun "בְצַקְלֶג" (vatzal'eg). The prefix "בְ" (be) indicates the preposition "in" or "with," and the root "צַקְלֶג" (tsal'eg) is the main part of the word.

Description: The exact meaning of "וּבְצַקְלֶג" is uncertain, as it appears only once in the Bible, in 1 Samuel 30:14. It is used to describe a place or a person, but its specific nature is not clear. Some interpretations suggest that it refers to a region or a city, while others propose that it might be a personal name.
