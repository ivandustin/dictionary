Etymology: The word "וּבְעָמְלְךָ" (u've'amlecha) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "וּ" (u) is a conjunction meaning "and," and "בְעָמְלְךָ" (ve'amlecha) is a noun derived from the root עמל (amal), which means "toil" or "labor." Therefore, the literal translation of "וּבְעָמְלְךָ" is "and in your toil" or "and in your labor."

Grammar: "וּבְעָמְלְךָ" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The conjunction "וּ" (u) connects it to the previous clause or sentence, indicating a continuation or addition. The preposition "בְ" (be) means "in" or "with," and it is followed by the noun "עָמְלְךָ" (amlecha), which means "your toil" or "your labor." The suffix "ךָ" (cha) indicates the second person singular possessive form, meaning "your."

Description: The phrase "וּבְעָמְלְךָ" is found in various biblical texts and is often used to emphasize the importance of hard work and labor. It can be interpreted as a reminder that success and achievement require effort and dedication.
