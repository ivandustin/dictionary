Etymology: The word "וּבָעֳלִי" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בָּעַל (ba'al), which means "to possess" or "to own." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the suffix י (i) indicates the first person possessive pronoun "my." Therefore, "וּבָעֳלִי" can be translated as "and my possession" or "and my ownership."

Grammar: "וּבָעֳלִי" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix וּ (u) is a conjunction meaning "and," and the noun בָעֳלִי (ba'oli) means "my possession" or "my ownership." In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, but "וּבָעֳלִי" is in the masculine singular form.

Description: "וּבָעֳלִי" is a term used in Hebrew to refer to something that belongs to the speaker. It can be used to indicate ownership or possession of an object, a person, or an idea. The word is often used in religious or poetic contexts to express a sense of personal connection or attachment to something.
