Description: The word "וְבָאבְנְט" is often used in the context of biblical or traditional Jewish clothing. In the Bible, priests and high priests were instructed to wear a special belt called אֵזוֹר (ezor) or אָבְנֵט (avnet) as part of their ceremonial attire. The belt served both practical and symbolic purposes, providing support for the garments and representing the priestly role and authority.

In modern usage, the word "וְבָאבְנְט" can also refer to any belt or sash worn around the waist, regardless of its religious or ceremonial significance.
