Etymology: The word "וּבְשָׁעִיר" (pronounced "u'vesha'ir") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וּ" (pronounced "u"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "בְּשָׁעִיר" (pronounced "b'sha'ir"), is a prepositional phrase that combines the preposition "בְּ" (pronounced "b") meaning "in" or "at," and the noun "שָׁעִיר" (pronounced "sha'ir") meaning "a goat" or "a he-goat."

Grammar: The word "וּבְשָׁעִיר" is a combination of a conjunction and a prepositional phrase. It is used to connect two elements or ideas and indicate that something is happening "in" or "at" a specific location, which in this case is "a goat" or "a he-goat."

Description: The word "וּבְשָׁעִיר" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Leviticus (16:7). It is used in the context of the Yom Kippur ritual, where the high priest is instructed to take two goats and perform various rituals with them. One goat is designated for sacrifice, while the other is sent away into the wilderness, symbolically carrying away the sins of the people. The phrase "וּבְשָׁעִיר" is used to describe the location where the second goat is sent, emphasizing the act of sending it away "in" or "at" a goat.
