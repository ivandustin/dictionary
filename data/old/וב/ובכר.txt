Etymology: The word "וּבְכָר" (pronounced "u'v'khar") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וּ" (pronounced "u"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "בְכָר" (pronounced "v'khar"), is a noun derived from the root בָּכַר (pronounced "bakhar"), which means "to be firstborn" or "to be the first in rank or importance."

Grammar: "וּבְכָר" is a compound word formed by combining the conjunction "וּ" with the noun "בְכָר." In Hebrew, compound words are formed by combining two or more words to create a new word with a different meaning.
