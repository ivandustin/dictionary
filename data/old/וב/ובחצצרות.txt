Etymology: The word "וּבַחְצְצְרוֹת" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב־ח־צ־ר, which means "to blow a trumpet" or "to sound a horn." The word is derived from the noun חֲצוֹצְרָה (chatzotzrah), which means "trumpet" or "horn."

Grammar: "וּבַחְצְצְרוֹת" is a phrase composed of the conjunction וּ (u), which means "and," and the noun בַחְצְצְרוֹת (bachatzotrot), which is the plural form of חֲצוֹצְרָה (chatzotzrah). In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). In this case, the noun is in the plural form, indicating that there are multiple trumpets or horns.
