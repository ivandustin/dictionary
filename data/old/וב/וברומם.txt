Etymology: The word "וּבְרוֹמִים" (pronounced "u'v'romim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-ר-מ (B-R-M), which means "to be high" or "to elevate." The prefix וּ (u) means "and," and the suffix ים (im) indicates plural masculine. Therefore, "וּבְרוֹמִים" translates to "and heights" or "and elevated places."

Grammar: "וּבְרוֹמִים" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix וּ (u) is a conjunction meaning "and," and בְ (b') is a preposition meaning "in" or "at." The root ר-ו-מ (R-W-M) is in the construct state, indicating a relationship between two nouns. The suffix ים (im) indicates plural masculine. Therefore, "וּבְרוֹמִים" can be translated as "in the heights" or "at the elevated places."
