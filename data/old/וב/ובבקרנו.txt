Etymology: The word "וַבַּקְרָנוֹ" (pronounced "vavakranu") is a Hebrew word that translates to "and his horn" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root בקרן (bkrn), which means "horn."

Grammar: "וַבַּקְרָנוֹ" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "וַ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and." The word "בַּקְרָנוֹ" (pronounced "bakranu") is a combination of the preposition "בְּ" (pronounced "be") meaning "in" or "with," and the noun "קֶרֶן" (pronounced "keren") meaning "horn." The suffix "וֹ" (pronounced "o") indicates possession, so "וַבַּקְרָנוֹ" can be translated as "and his horn."

Description: "וַבַּקְרָנוֹ" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to the horn of an animal, particularly in the context of strength, power, or authority. It is often used metaphorically to symbolize the power or might of an individual or a nation.
