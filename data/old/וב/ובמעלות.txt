Etymology: The word "וּבְמַעֲלוֹת" (u'vema'alot) is a Hebrew word that is composed of two parts. "וּ" (u) is a conjunction meaning "and," and "בְמַעֲלוֹת" (bema'alot) is a noun derived from the root עָלָה (alah), which means "to go up" or "to ascend." The word can be translated as "and in the ascents" or "and in the steps."

Grammar: "וּבְמַעֲלוֹת" (u'vema'alot) is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial phrase. The conjunction "וּ" (u) connects it to the rest of the sentence, and "בְמַעֲלוֹת" (bema'alot) describes the manner or location of the action.

Description: "וּבְמַעֲלוֹת" (u'vema'alot) is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the titles of certain Psalms (Psalms 120-134). These psalms are known as the "Songs of Ascents" or "Pilgrim Songs" and were likely sung by pilgrims as they ascended to Jerusalem for the annual festivals. The phrase "וּבְמַעֲלוֹת" (u'vema'alot) is believed to indicate that these psalms were sung during the ascent to Jerusalem.
