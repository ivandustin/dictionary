The prefix וַ (va) means "and," and the suffix תָּרוּתְךָ (tarutecha) is a possessive form of the noun תּוֹרָה (torah), which means "law" or "instruction." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and your law" or "and your instruction."

In this case, the possessive form indicates that the law or instruction belongs to "you" (the second person singular).
