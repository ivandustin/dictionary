Etymology: The word "וַבְזֵה" (vav-zayin-heh-aleph) is a Hebrew word that means "and in this" or "and by this." It is derived from the root בָּזָה (bazah), which means "to despise" or "to treat with contempt."

Grammar: "וַבְזֵה" is a conjunction in Hebrew, specifically a compound conjunction. It is formed by combining the prefix וַ (vav) meaning "and" with the preposition בְּ (bet) meaning "in" or "by," and the pronoun זֶה (zeh) meaning "this." It is used to connect two clauses or phrases together, indicating a relationship of cause and effect or a sequence of events.

Description: "וַבְזֵה" is commonly used in biblical Hebrew to introduce a consequence or result that follows from a previous statement. It is often translated as "and by this" or "and in this way." It is used to emphasize the cause-and-effect relationship between two clauses or to indicate a logical progression of events.
