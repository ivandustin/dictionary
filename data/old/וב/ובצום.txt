Etymology: The word "וּבְצוֹם" (pronounced "u'v'tsom") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וּ" (pronounced "u"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "בְצוֹם" (pronounced "b'tsom"), is a noun derived from the Hebrew root "צ.ו.ם" (pronounced "ts.v.m"), which means "to fast." Therefore, "וּבְצוֹם" can be translated as "and fasting" or "and in a fast."

Grammar: "וּבְצוֹם" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The conjunction "וּ" (and) connects it to another element in a sentence. The preposition "בְ" (in) indicates the state or condition of being in a fast. The noun "צוֹם" (fast) is in the construct state, indicating its connection to the preposition.

Description: "וּבְצוֹם" is used in Hebrew to describe the state of fasting or being in a fast. It can be used to indicate that someone is observing a fast or abstaining from food and/or drink for a specific period of time, often for religious or spiritual purposes.
