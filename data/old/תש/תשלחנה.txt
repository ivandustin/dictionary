Grammar: "תְּשַׁלְחֵנִי" is a verb form in the imperative mood, which is used to give commands or make requests. The prefix תְּ (te) indicates the second person feminine singular, and the root שׁ-ל-ח (sh-l-ch) is followed by the suffix נִי (ni), which means "me." Therefore, the word can be translated as "send me away" or "cast me away."
