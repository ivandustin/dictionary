Grammar: תְּשָׁעִים (tesha'im) is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The plural form is used to indicate more than one object or person. In this case, תְּשָׁעִים (tesha'im) refers to multiple instances of the number תֵּשַׁע (tesha).
