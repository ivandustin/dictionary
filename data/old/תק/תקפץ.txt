Etymology: The word "תקפה" (pronounced "tekufah") comes from the Hebrew root ת-ק-פ, which means "to go around" or "to revolve." It is derived from the ancient Semitic word "takapu," which also means "to go around" or "to encircle."

Grammar: "תקפה" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is a feminine singular form, and it is used to describe a specific period of time in the Jewish calendar. In modern Hebrew, it is commonly used to refer to the four seasons of the year.

Description: In Jewish tradition, "תקפה" refers to the four seasonal divisions of the year, which are based on the solstices and equinoxes. These divisions are known as "תקופות" (tekufot) in Hebrew. Each תקופה (tekufah) marks the beginning of a new season: spring (תקופת האביב), summer (תקופת הקיץ), autumn (תקופת הסתיו), and winter (תקופת החורף). These divisions are important in determining the dates of Jewish holidays and agricultural practices.
