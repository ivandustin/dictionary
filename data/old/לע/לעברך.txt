Etymology: The word "לעברית" (pronounced "le'ivrit") is the Hebrew word for "Hebrew". It comes from the root word "עבר" (pronounced "avar"), which means "to pass over" or "to cross". This is because Hebrew is the language of the Hebrew people, who crossed over the Jordan River into the land of Israel.

Grammar: In Hebrew, words are formed by combining root letters with various prefixes, suffixes, and vowel patterns. The word "לעברית" consists of the preposition "ל" (pronounced "le"), which means "to" or "for", and the noun "עברית" (pronounced "ivrit"), which means "Hebrew". The preposition "ל" indicates direction or purpose, and in this case, it indicates that the word "עברית" is related to Hebrew.
