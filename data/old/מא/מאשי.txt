Etymology: The word "מאשי" (pronounced "ma'ashi") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root אשה (pronounced "isha"), which means "woman" in Hebrew. The prefix מ (pronounced "me") is added to the root to indicate possession or belonging, so מאשי literally means "of a woman" or "belonging to a woman."

Grammar: In Hebrew, מאשי is a possessive adjective that agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies. It is used to indicate that something belongs to or is associated with a woman. For example, מאשי ספר (ma'ashi sefer) means "my book" when referring to a book belonging to a woman.

Description: מאשי is a versatile word that can be used in various contexts to indicate possession or association with a woman. It is commonly used in everyday speech and writing in Hebrew.
