Etymology: The word "מאחריה" (ma'achariah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root א.ח.ר (a.ch.r), which means "to delay" or "to be late." The prefix מ (ma) indicates "from" or "of," and the suffix ה (ah) denotes the feminine form. Therefore, מאחריה can be translated as "from her delay" or "of her lateness."

Grammar: מאחריה is a noun in the feminine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word can be used to refer to a specific woman or to women in general.

Description: מאחריה is often used to describe a woman who is habitually late or tends to delay things. It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is slow or procrastinates.
