Etymology: The word "מאלה" (pronounced "meh-lah") is a Hebrew word that means "from these" or "from them." It is a combination of the preposition "מ" (pronounced "meh"), meaning "from," and the plural form of the pronoun "אלה" (pronounced "eh-leh"), meaning "these" or "them."

Grammar: "מאלה" is a compound word made up of the preposition "מ" and the plural form of the pronoun "אלה." In Hebrew, prepositions are used to indicate relationships between words, and pronouns are used to replace nouns. The combination of these two elements creates a word that means "from these" or "from them."

Description: The word "מאלה" is commonly used in Hebrew to refer to something that originates or comes from a specific group of people or objects. It can be used to indicate possession, origin, or source. For example, if someone says "הגיע מאלה" (pronounced "hah-gee-ah meh-lah"), it means "he/she came from them" or "he/she came from those people/objects."
