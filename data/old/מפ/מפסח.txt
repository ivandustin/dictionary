Etymology: The word "מפסח" (matsah) comes from the Hebrew root פסח (p-s-ch), which means "to pass over" or "to spare." It is derived from the biblical story of the Exodus, where God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites during the tenth plague in Egypt.

Grammar: "מפסח" (matsah) is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to unleavened bread, which is traditionally eaten during the Jewish holiday of Passover. It is also used as a verb to describe the act of eating unleavened bread during Passover.

Description: "מפסח" (matsah) is a flat, unleavened bread made from flour and water. It is a central element of the Passover Seder, a ritual meal that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. During Passover, leavened bread is prohibited, and instead, matsah is eaten to symbolize the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, as they did not have time to let their bread rise. Matsah is often eaten with other symbolic foods during the Seder, such as bitter herbs and charoset.
