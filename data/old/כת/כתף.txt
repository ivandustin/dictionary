Etymology: The word "כתף" (katef) comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root כ.ת.ף (k.t.f), which means "to shoulder" or "to bear a burden."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "כתף" (katef) is a noun that is used to refer to the shoulder, specifically the upper part of the arm where it connects to the body.

Description: The shoulder is an important part of the human body that allows for a wide range of movement and flexibility. It is a joint that connects the arm to the torso and is responsible for the movement of the arm. The shoulder is made up of several bones, including the clavicle (collarbone), scapula (shoulder blade), and humerus (upper arm bone). It is also supported by muscles, tendons, and ligaments that help stabilize and move the joint. The shoulder is involved in various activities such as lifting, throwing, and reaching.
