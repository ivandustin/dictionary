Grammar: In Hebrew, כתפוח is a noun that is used to describe a specific type of fruit. It is a compound word made up of כתף (katef), meaning "shoulder," and פוח (poch), meaning "swollen" or "inflated." The word is used to describe a fruit that has a round shape, similar to the shape of a shoulder.

Description: כתפוח is a Hebrew word that refers to a specific type of fruit, commonly known as a "quince" in English. The quince is a fruit that is similar in appearance to a pear, but with a more irregular shape. It has a tough, yellowish skin and a firm, tart flesh. Quinces are often used in cooking and baking, as they have a unique flavor that becomes sweeter when cooked. They are also known for their high pectin content, which makes them ideal for making jams and jellies.
