Etymology: The word "כתובה" (ketubah) comes from the Hebrew root כתב (k-t-v), which means "to write." It is derived from the Aramaic word "כתובתא" (ketuvta), which means "a written document."

Grammar: "כתובה" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a legal document that outlines the financial and marital obligations of a husband towards his wife in Jewish law.

Description: In Jewish tradition, a ketubah is a marriage contract that is signed by the groom and given to the bride before the wedding ceremony. It serves as a legal and binding agreement that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both parties in the marriage. The ketubah typically includes details such as the husband's financial obligations, the wife's rights in case of divorce or widowhood, and provisions for the wife's support and protection. The ketubah is often beautifully decorated and is considered an important symbol of the marriage covenant.
