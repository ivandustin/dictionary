Etymology: The word "כתבן" (pronounced "k'taván") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כ-ת-ב (k-t-v), which means "to write" in Hebrew. The suffix ן (-an) indicates a plural form, so כתבן literally means "writings" or "writings of."

Grammar: כתבן is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the masculine plural form, indicating multiple writings. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also be declined for case (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.).

Description: כתבן refers to a collection of writings or written works. It can be used to describe various types of written materials, such as books, manuscripts, documents, or even literary works. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to the body of written knowledge or literature in a particular language or culture.
