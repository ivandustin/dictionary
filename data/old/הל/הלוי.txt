Grammar: "הַלוֹי" (halo'i) is a masculine noun in the singular form. It is used to refer to a Levite, a member of the tribe of Levi in ancient Israel. In Hebrew grammar, it is classified as a common noun.

Description: The Levites were a special group of people in ancient Israel who were responsible for serving in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple. They were not given a specific portion of land like the other tribes, but instead were scattered throughout the land and given cities to live in. The Levites had various duties, including assisting the priests in their religious duties, teaching the people, and maintaining the sacred spaces. They were also responsible for singing and playing musical instruments during worship. The word "הַלוֹי" (halo'i) is often used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the Levites and their role in the religious life of Israel.
