Grammar: In Hebrew, "הלהן" is a demonstrative pronoun that is used to indicate a specific group of objects or people that are relatively far from the speaker. It is the plural form of the word "הלזה" (ha-lazeh), which means "this" or "that."

Description: "הלהן" is used to refer to a group of objects or people that are not close to the speaker. It is often used to point out or identify things that are physically distant or not within immediate reach. For example, if someone is pointing at a group of books on a shelf and wants to refer to them, they might say "הלהן" to indicate those books.
