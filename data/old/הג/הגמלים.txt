Description: "הגמלים" refers to camels in Hebrew. Camels are large mammals known for their ability to travel long distances in arid regions. They have a distinctive hump on their back, which stores fat that can be used as a source of energy during times of scarcity. Camels are commonly found in the Middle East and North Africa and have been used for transportation and as pack animals for centuries. They are well-adapted to desert environments and are known for their ability to withstand extreme temperatures and go without water for long periods of time.
