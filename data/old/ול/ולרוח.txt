Etymology: The word "וָלֹרוּחַ" (pronounced "v'aloruch") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "רוח" (pronounced "ruach"), which means "spirit" or "breath". The prefix "וְ" (pronounced "ve") means "and". Therefore, "וָלֹרוּחַ" can be translated as "and to the spirit" or "and to the breath".

Grammar: "וָלֹרוּחַ" is a combination of the conjunction "וְ" (pronounced "ve"), which means "and", and the noun "לֹרוּחַ" (pronounced "loruch"), which means "to the spirit" or "to the breath". In Hebrew, nouns are often preceded by a preposition to indicate direction or purpose.

Description: "וָלֹרוּחַ" is a phrase that is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to describe the act of God breathing life into human beings. It is found in Genesis 2:7, which states, "Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being." The phrase emphasizes the divine origin of human life and the connection between the physical body and the spiritual essence.
