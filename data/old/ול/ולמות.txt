Etymology: The word "וָלְמוֹת" (pronounced "v'al'mot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "מות" (pronounced "mot"), which means "to die" or "death". The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and". Therefore, "וָלְמוֹת" can be translated as "and to die" or "and death".

Grammar: "וָלְמוֹת" is a combination of the conjunction "וָ" (pronounced "va") and the infinitive form of the verb "לָמוּת" (pronounced "la'mut"), which means "to die". The prefix "וָ" is used to connect the verb to another word or phrase. In this case, it is used to express the concept of "and" or "to".
