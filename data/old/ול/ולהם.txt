Etymology: The word "וֹלְהֵם" (pronounced "volhem") is a Hebrew word. It is a combination of the preposition "וֹ" (pronounced "vo") meaning "and" and the noun "לֵהֵם" (pronounced "lehem") meaning "them".

Grammar: "וֹלְהֵם" is a compound word formed by combining the preposition "וֹ" (and) with the noun "לֵהֵם" (them). In Hebrew, the preposition "וֹ" is used to connect words or phrases, and the noun "לֵהֵם" is the plural form of the pronoun "לו" (to him). Therefore, "וֹלְהֵם" means "and to them" or "and for them".
