Etymology: The word "וְלָאֶשְׁרָה" (vela'eshrah) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "וְ" (ve), meaning "and," and "לָאֶשְׁרָה" (la'eshrah), which is a combination of the preposition "לְ" (le), meaning "to," and the noun "אֶשְׁרָה" (eshrah), meaning "grove" or "sacred tree." 

Grammar: "וְלָאֶשְׁרָה" is a phrase composed of the conjunction "וְ" (ve) and the preposition "לְ" (le) followed by the noun "אֶשְׁרָה" (eshrah). The conjunction "וְ" (ve) connects the phrase to the previous sentence or clause, indicating a continuation or addition. The preposition "לְ" (le) expresses the direction or purpose of the action, in this case, "to" or "for." The noun "אֶשְׁרָה" (eshrah) refers to a grove or sacred tree, often associated with ancient Canaanite and Israelite religious practices.

Description: "וְלָאֶשְׁרָה" is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in Deuteronomy 16:21. It is part of a commandment given to the Israelites to not plant any "אֲשֵׁרָה" (asherah) near the altar of the Lord. The phrase emphasizes the prohibition of establishing or dedicating a grove or sacred tree for religious purposes. It reflects the religious and cultural context of ancient Israel, where the worship of Asherah, a Canaanite goddess associated with fertility and nature, was prevalent. The commandment aimed to discourage the assimilation of Canaanite religious practices into Israelite worship.
