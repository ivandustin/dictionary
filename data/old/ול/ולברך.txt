Description: Hail is a form of solid precipitation that consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice. It is typically formed in thunderstorms when there are strong updrafts that carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere. As the raindrops freeze, they accumulate layers of ice, forming hailstones. Hailstones can vary in size, from small pellets to large stones several centimeters in diameter. When hail falls to the ground, it can cause damage to crops, vehicles, and buildings.
