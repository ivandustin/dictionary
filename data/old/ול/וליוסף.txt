Etymology: The word "וֹלְיוֹסֵף" (pronounced "vol-yo-sef") is a Hebrew name that originated from the Hebrew Bible. It is composed of two elements: "וֹלְיוֹ" (vol-yo), which means "and he will add," and "סֵף" (sef), which means "end" or "boundary." Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "he will add to the end" or "he will increase until the boundary."

Grammar: "וֹלְיוֹסֵף" is a masculine Hebrew name. It is formed by combining the prefix "וֹ" (meaning "and") with the root "ל.י.ס.ף" (meaning "to add" or "to increase"). The suffix "סֵף" is added to the root to form the complete name.
