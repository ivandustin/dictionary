Etymology: The word "וְלָאָבִירִים" is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root letters ל-א-ב-ר, which means "to be strong" or "to be mighty." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the suffix ים (yim) indicates plural form. Therefore, the word can be translated as "and the mighty ones" or "and the strong ones."

Grammar: "וְלָאָבִירִים" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix וְ (vav) is a conjunction that means "and." The definite article הַ (ha) is not present in this word, so it is not specific to a particular group of mighty ones. The noun אָבִירִים (avirim) is in the plural form, indicating multiple mighty ones.

Description: The word "וְלָאָבִירִים" is used in Hebrew to refer to strong or mighty individuals. It can be used to describe warriors, heroes, or powerful individuals in various contexts.
