Etymology: The word "וּלְעָלִיא" (pronounced "ul'al'ya") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "עָלָה" (pronounced "a'la"), which means "to go up" or "to ascend." The prefix "וּ" (pronounced "u") means "and," and the prefix "לְ" (pronounced "le") means "to" or "for." Therefore, "וּלְעָלִיא" can be translated as "and to ascend" or "and for going up."

The conjunction "וּ" is used to connect words or phrases, and the preposition "לְ" indicates direction or purpose. The noun "עָלִיא" means "going up" or "ascent."
