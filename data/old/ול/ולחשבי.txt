Etymology: The word "וּלְחַשְׁבִּי" (pronounced "ul'chashbi") is a Hebrew word that combines the conjunction "וּ" (pronounced "u") meaning "and" with the verb "לְחַשֵּׁב" (pronounced "lechashav") meaning "to think" or "to consider". The suffix "־ִי" (pronounced "-i") indicates the first person singular possessive form, so "וּלְחַשְׁבִּי" can be translated as "and my thinking" or "and my consideration".

Grammar: "וּלְחַשְׁבִּי" is a compound word formed by combining the conjunction "וּ" (and) with the verb "לְחַשֵּׁב" (to think) and the possessive suffix "-י" (my). In Hebrew, compound words are formed by combining different parts of speech to create new meanings.
