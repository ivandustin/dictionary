Etymology: The word "וָלְמִישְׁאֵל" (pronounced "V'al-mi-sha-el") is a Hebrew name composed of two elements. The first part, "וָל" (pronounced "v'al"), is a conjunction meaning "and" or "but." The second part, "מִישְׁאֵל" (pronounced "mi-sha-el"), is a compound name formed from the Hebrew words "מִי" (pronounced "mi"), meaning "who," and "שָׁאַל" (pronounced "sha-al"), meaning "asked" or "inquired." Therefore, the name "וָלְמִישְׁאֵל" can be translated as "and who asked of God" or "but who inquired of God."

Grammar: "וָלְמִישְׁאֵל" is a masculine Hebrew name. It consists of the conjunction "וָל" (and) followed by the compound name "מִישְׁאֵל" (who asked of God). In Hebrew, names can often have significant meanings or convey certain qualities or characteristics.
