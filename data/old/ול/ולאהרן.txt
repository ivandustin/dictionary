Etymology: The word "וְלָאֵהָרֹן" (pronounced "vela'eharon") is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "וְ" (pronounced "ve") means "and" in Hebrew, and "לָאֵהָרֹן" (pronounced "la'eharon") is a combination of two words: "לֹא" (pronounced "lo") meaning "not" and "אֵהָרֹן" (pronounced "eharon") which is the name "Aaron" in Hebrew. Therefore, the phrase "וְלָאֵהָרֹן" can be translated as "and not Aaron" or "and not to Aaron."

Grammar: "וְלָאֵהָרֹן" is a combination of the Hebrew conjunction "וְ" (ve) meaning "and" and the preposition "לָ" (la) meaning "to" or "for." The word "אֵהָרֹן" (eharon) is the name "Aaron" in Hebrew. The phrase is used to indicate that something is not intended for or directed towards Aaron.

Description: The phrase "וְלָאֵהָרֹן" is found in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Exodus. It is used in various contexts to indicate that certain actions or instructions are not meant for Aaron, but for someone else. The phrase highlights the distinction between Aaron and another person or group of people.
