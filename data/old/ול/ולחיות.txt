Etymology: The word "וּלְחִיוֹת" (pronounced "ul'chiyot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "חַיִּים" (pronounced "chayim"), which means "life" or "living." The prefix "וּ" (pronounced "u") means "and," and the prefix "לְ" (pronounced "le") means "to" or "for." Therefore, "וּלְחִיוֹת" can be translated as "and to live" or "and for living."

Grammar: "וּלְחִיוֹת" is a combination of the conjunction "וּ" (pronounced "u") and the infinitive construct form of the verb "חַיָּה" (pronounced "chayah"), which means "to live." The prefix "לְ" (pronounced "le") indicates the purpose or goal of the action, and the suffix "-ת" (pronounced "-ot") indicates the infinitive construct form of the verb.
