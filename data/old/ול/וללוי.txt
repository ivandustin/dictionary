Etymology: The word "וָלֹוִי" (pronounced "vav-lo-ee") is a Hebrew name that is derived from the Hebrew root וָלָה (valah), meaning "to join" or "to attach." It is also associated with the Hebrew word לֵוִי (Levi), which is the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

Grammar: "וָלֹוִי" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is written with the Hebrew letters ו (vav), ל (lamed), ו (vav), י (yod). The word is used to refer to someone from the tribe of Levi or to the Levites, who were responsible for religious duties in ancient Israel.

Description: The word "וָלֹוִי" is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe the descendants of Levi, who were chosen to serve as priests and assistants in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple. They were not given a specific portion of land like the other tribes, but were allocated cities throughout the land of Israel. The Levites played a crucial role in the religious rituals and ceremonies of ancient Israel.
