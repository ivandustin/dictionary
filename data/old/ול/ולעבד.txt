Etymology: The word "וָלֶעָבְדָה" (pronounced "v'le'avdah") is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two words: "וָ" (pronounced "vah") meaning "and" and "לֶעָבְדָה" (pronounced "le'avdah") meaning "to serve." 

Grammar: "וָלֶעָבְדָה" is a combination of the conjunction "וָ" (meaning "and") and the infinitive verb "לֶעָבְדָה" (meaning "to serve"). The verb is in the infinitive form, which indicates the action of serving. The prefix "וָ" connects the verb to another word or phrase in the sentence.

Description: "וָלֶעָבְדָה" is a phrase that is often used in Jewish liturgy and religious texts. It is derived from a verse in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 23:25) which states, "וַעֲבַדְתֶּם אֵת יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם" (pronounced "va'avadtem et Adonai Eloheichem"), meaning "And you shall serve the Lord your God." The phrase emphasizes the importance of serving and worshiping God.
