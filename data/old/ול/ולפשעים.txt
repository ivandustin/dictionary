Etymology: The word "וּלְפֵשְׁעִים" (pronounced "ul'fesh'im") is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "וּלְ" (pronounced "ul") means "and to" or "and for" in English, and "פֵּשַׁע" (pronounced "pesh'a") means "transgression" or "sin." Therefore, "וּלְפֵשְׁעִים" can be translated as "and for transgressors" or "and to sinners."

The word "וּלְ" is a conjunction that connects the phrase to the rest of the sentence, and "פֵּשַׁעִים" is the noun form of the word "פֵּשַׁע" (transgression). In Hebrew grammar, prepositional phrases often function as adverbial phrases, modifying the verb or the entire sentence.
