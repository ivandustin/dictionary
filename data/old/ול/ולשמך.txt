Etymology: The word "וּלְשַׁמְתָּךְ" (pronounced "ul'shamtakh") is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "וּלְ" (pronounced "ul") means "and to" or "and for" in English, and "שַׁמְתָּךְ" (pronounced "shamtakh") is the second person singular feminine form of the verb "שִׁים" (pronounced "shim"), which means "to put" or "to place." Therefore, the literal translation of "וּלְשַׁמְתָּךְ" is "and to put for you" or "and to place for you."

Grammar: "וּלְשַׁמְתָּךְ" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "וּלְ" (ul) combines the conjunction "וּ" (u) meaning "and" with the preposition "לְ" (le) meaning "to" or "for." The verb "שִׁים" (shim) is in the imperative form, addressing the second person singular feminine. The pronoun "ךְ" (kha) is a possessive pronoun meaning "your" in the feminine form.
