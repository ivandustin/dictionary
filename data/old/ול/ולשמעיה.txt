Etymology: The word "וּלְשֵׁמְעִיָּה" (pronounced "ulshemiyah") is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "וּלְ" (pronounced "ul") means "and to" or "and for" in English, and "שֵׁמְעִיָּה" (pronounced "shemiyah") is a proper name derived from the Hebrew word "שֵׁם" (pronounced "shem") meaning "name" and the Hebrew word "עִיָּה" (pronounced "iyah") meaning "God." Therefore, the phrase can be translated as "and for the name of God" or "and to the name of God."

Grammar: "וּלְשֵׁמְעִיָּה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "וּלְ" (ul) combines the conjunction "וּ" (u) meaning "and" with the preposition "לְ" (le) meaning "to" or "for." The proper name "שֵׁמְעִיָּה" (shemiyah) functions as the object of the preposition.
