Etymology: The word "וּלְאֵישׁ" (pronounced "ul'ish") is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "וּלְ" (pronounced "ul") means "and to" or "and for" in English, and "אִישׁ" (pronounced "ish") means "man" or "person." Therefore, "וּלְאֵישׁ" can be translated as "and to the man" or "and for the man."

Grammar: "וּלְאֵישׁ" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "וּלְ" (ul) combines the conjunction "וּ" (u) meaning "and" with the preposition "לְ" (le) meaning "to" or "for." The noun "אִישׁ" (ish) functions as the object of the preposition, indicating that the action or state described in the sentence is directed towards or intended for a man.
