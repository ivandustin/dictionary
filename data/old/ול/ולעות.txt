Etymology: The word "וָלָאֵת" (pronounced "vela'et" in Hebrew) is a combination of two words: "וָלָא" (pronounced "vela") meaning "and not" or "but not," and "אֵת" (pronounced "et") which is a direct object marker in Hebrew. 

Grammar: "וָלָאֵת" is a compound word that is used in Hebrew grammar to negate the direct object of a verb. It is formed by combining the conjunction "וָלָא" with the direct object marker "אֵת." When used in a sentence, it indicates that the action of the verb does not apply to the specific direct object mentioned.
