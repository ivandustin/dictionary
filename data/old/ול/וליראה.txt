Grammar: "וִלִירָאָה" is a verb phrase in Hebrew that combines the conjunction "וִ" with the infinitive form of the verb "לִרְאוֹת" (pronounced "lir'ot"). The conjunction "וִ" connects the verb to another word or phrase, indicating that the action of seeing is being done in conjunction with something else.
