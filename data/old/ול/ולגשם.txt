Etymology: The word "וֹלְגֶשֶׁם" (volgeshem) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "וֹלְג" (volg) and "שֶׁם" (shem). "וֹלְג" is derived from the root וּלְגַלֵּשׁ (ulgallesh), which means "to slide" or "to glide." "שֶׁם" means "name." Therefore, "וֹלְגֶשֶׁם" can be translated as "sliding name" or "gliding name."

Grammar: "וֹלְגֶשֶׁם" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is masculine and singular.

Description: "וֹלְגֶשֶׁם" is a poetic term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to describe a type of precious stone. The exact identification of this stone is uncertain, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Some scholars suggest that it could refer to a type of jasper or agate. The stone is described as being part of the high priest's breastplate and is associated with the tribe of Gad.
