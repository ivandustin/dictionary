Etymology: The word "וָלְאוֹת" (pronounced "val'ot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "לאה" (pronounced "lah"), which means "to swear" or "to take an oath." The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וָלְאוֹת" can be translated as "and oaths" or "and swearing."
