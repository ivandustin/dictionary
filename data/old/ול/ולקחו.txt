Etymology: The word "וּלְקַחוֹ" (ul'kacho) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "וּ" (u) meaning "and" and "לְקַחוֹ" (lekacho) meaning "his taking" or "his acquisition." 

Grammar: "וּלְקַחוֹ" is a combination of a conjunction ("וּ") and a possessive pronoun ("לְקַחוֹ"). The conjunction "וּ" connects two elements in a sentence, usually indicating a continuation or addition. The possessive pronoun "לְקַחוֹ" is formed by combining the preposition "לְ" (le) meaning "to" or "for" with the noun "קַחוֹ" (kacho) meaning "his taking" or "his acquisition."

Description: "וּלְקַחוֹ" is used in Hebrew to express the possessive form of the phrase "his taking" or "his acquisition." It is often used in biblical texts to indicate ownership or possession.
