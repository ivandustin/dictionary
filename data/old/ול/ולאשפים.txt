Etymology: The word "וּלְאַשְׁפִּים" (pronounced "ul'ashpim") is a Hebrew word that is composed of two parts. The first part, "וּלְ" (pronounced "ul"), is a conjunction meaning "and" or "to." The second part, "אַשְׁפִּים" (pronounced "ashpim"), is a plural noun derived from the root word "שׁפם" (pronounced "shafam"), which means "to practice magic" or "to perform sorcery."

Grammar: "וּלְאַשְׁפִּים" is a combination of the conjunction "וּלְ" and the noun "אַשְׁפִּים." The conjunction "וּלְ" is used to connect two elements, indicating that the action or state described by the second element is in addition to the first element. The noun "אַשְׁפִּים" is in the plural form, indicating that it refers to multiple individuals or entities practicing magic or sorcery.

Description: "וּלְאַשְׁפִּים" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to individuals who practice magic or sorcery. It is often associated with pagan or idolatrous practices that were condemned by the Israelites. The term is used in several passages to warn against engaging in such practices and to emphasize the importance of worshiping the one true God.
