Etymology: The word "וָלְאָשִׁיו" (pronounced "v'al'ashiv") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "לאשוב" (lashuv), which means "to return" or "to go back." The prefix "וָ" (vav) in this word indicates the conjunction "and," and the suffix "יו" (yod-vav) is a possessive pronoun meaning "his." Therefore, "וָלְאָשִׁיו" can be translated as "and his return" or "and his going back."
