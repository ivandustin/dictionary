Etymology: The word "וָלְעוֹלֶת" (pronounced "v'al'olat") is a Hebrew term that is derived from the root word "עולה" (pronounced "o'leh"), which means "to go up" or "to ascend." The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and." The word "עולת" (pronounced "o'lat") is the construct form of "עולה" and is used to indicate a specific type of offering in the Hebrew Bible.

Grammar: "וָלְעוֹלֶת" is a noun phrase composed of the conjunction "וָ" (and) and the noun "עוֹלֶת" (offering). In Hebrew grammar, the construct form is used to indicate a relationship between two nouns, where the first noun modifies or specifies the second noun. In this case, "וָלְעוֹלֶת" can be translated as "and for the offering" or "and of the offering."

Description: "וָלְעוֹלֶת" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to a specific type of offering, known as a burnt offering or an ascent offering. This type of offering was completely consumed by fire on the altar as a symbol of complete dedication and surrender to God. The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship and was often accompanied by other types of offerings, such as grain offerings or peace offerings. The purpose of the burnt offering was to express devotion, atonement, or thanksgiving to God.
