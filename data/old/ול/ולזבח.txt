Etymology: The word "וָלֶזְבַּח" (pronounced "val'ezbach") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "זבח" (pronounced "zavach"), which means "to sacrifice" or "to offer." The prefix "וָ" (pronounced "va") is a conjunction that means "and." Therefore, "וָלֶזְבַּח" can be translated as "and to sacrifice" or "and to offer a sacrifice."

Grammar: "וָלֶזְבַּח" is a compound word made up of the conjunction "וָ" (and) and the noun "לֶזְבַּח" (to sacrifice). In Hebrew, compound words are formed by combining two or more words to create a new word with a different meaning.

Description: "וָלֶזְבַּח" is used in the Hebrew language to describe the act of sacrificing or offering a sacrifice. It can refer to the ritual practice of offering an animal or other item as an act of worship or devotion. In biblical times, sacrifices were an important part of religious ceremonies and were believed to be a way of seeking forgiveness, expressing gratitude, or seeking divine favor.
