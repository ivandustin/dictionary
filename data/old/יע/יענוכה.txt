Description: Hanukkah is an eight-day Jewish holiday that usually falls in December. It commemorates the victory of the Maccabees, a Jewish rebel group, over the Seleucid Empire and the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. The holiday is celebrated by lighting the Hanukkah menorah, a special nine-branched candelabrum, and by playing a game with a spinning top called a dreidel. Hanukkah is also known for its traditional foods, such as latkes (potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (jelly-filled doughnuts).
