Etymology: The word "נבלה" (Nevilah) comes from the Hebrew root נ-ב-ל (N-B-L), which means "to fade" or "to wither." It is derived from the noun נֶבֶל (nevel), which means "withered" or "faded."

Grammar: "נבלה" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to an animal that has died from natural causes or disease and is therefore not fit for consumption according to Jewish dietary laws.

Description: In Jewish dietary laws, "נבלה" refers to an animal that has not been properly slaughtered or has died from causes other than ritual slaughter. It is considered non-kosher and is prohibited from being eaten by observant Jews. The term is also used more broadly to describe something that is considered unclean or impure.
