Etymology: The word "נבר" (pronounced "nabar") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root נ.ב.ר (n.b.r), which means "to prophesy" or "to speak on behalf of God." 

Grammar: In Hebrew, נבר is a verb in the Qal (simple) conjugation, which is the basic form of the verb. It is in the third person masculine singular form. 

Description: נבר is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe the act of prophesying or speaking on behalf of God. It is often used to refer to the messages and predictions delivered by prophets. Prophets were seen as intermediaries between God and the people, and their role was to convey God's will and guidance to the community. The act of prophesying was considered a divine gift and was highly respected in ancient Israelite society.
