Description: "נביאים" (Nevi'im) is a term used in Judaism to refer to the second section of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Nevi'im or the Prophets. It includes the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. These books contain the writings and prophecies of various prophets who played significant roles in the history and religious development of the Israelites.
