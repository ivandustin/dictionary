Etymology: The word "בהיותו" (behiyoto) is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: "ב" (be), which means "in" or "during", "היות" (hiyut), which means "being" or "existence", and "ו" (o), which is a conjunction meaning "and". Together, the word can be translated as "in his being" or "during his existence".

Grammar: "בהיותו" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. It is formed by combining the preposition "ב" (be) with the noun "היות" (hiyut), which is derived from the verb "היה" (haya) meaning "to be". The suffix "ו" (o) is added to indicate possession or association.

Description: "בהיותו" is used to describe a state or condition of being. It is often used in philosophical or theological contexts to discuss the nature of existence or the essence of something.
