Etymology: The word "בהיותם" is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: "ב" (pronounced "be"), which means "in" or "during", "היותם" (pronounced "hayotam"), which is a combination of the verb "היה" (pronounced "haya"), meaning "to be", and the suffix "ם" (pronounced "am"), which indicates the plural form. Therefore, "בהיותם" can be translated as "in their being" or "during their existence".

Grammar: "בהיותם" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew, composed of the preposition "ב" (pronounced "be") and the noun "היותם" (pronounced "hayotam"). The preposition "ב" means "in" or "during", and the noun "היותם" is the plural form of the verb "היה" (pronounced "haya"), which means "to be". Together, they form a phrase that indicates the state or existence of a plural subject.

Description: The word "בהיותם" is used in Hebrew to describe a situation or event that occurs during the existence or being of a plural subject. It is often used in a philosophical or abstract context to discuss the nature of existence or the state of being.
