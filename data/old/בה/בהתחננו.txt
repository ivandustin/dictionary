Etymology: The word "בהתחננו" (behit'chanenu) is a Hebrew verb form derived from the root ח.נ.נ (ch.n.n), which means "to beseech" or "to implore." The prefix ב (be) indicates the reflexive form, meaning "ourselves" or "ourselves to."

Grammar: "בהתחננו" is the reflexive hif'il verb form in the past tense, first person plural. In Hebrew grammar, the hif'il verb form is often used to express causative or intensive actions. The reflexive form indicates that the subject is performing the action on themselves.

Description: "בהתחננו" translates to "we beseeched ourselves" or "we implored ourselves." It implies that the subject, in this case, a group of people, earnestly and fervently pleaded or begged for something, possibly from a higher power or from within themselves.
