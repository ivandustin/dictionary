Etymology: The word "בהרת" (beheret) comes from the Hebrew root ב-ה-ר, which means "to shine" or "to glow." It is derived from the noun "הר" (har), meaning "mountain," and is related to the idea of a mountain peak shining brightly.

Grammar: "בהרת" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to describe a specific skin condition mentioned in the Bible, commonly translated as "leprosy." In Hebrew grammar, it is classified as a noun of state or condition.

Description: In the Bible, "בהרת" refers to a skin disease that affects not only the skin but also the hair and clothing. It is described as a white or reddish patch that spreads and can cause the affected person to be declared ritually impure. The exact nature of this disease is uncertain, as the symptoms described in the Bible do not match any known medical condition today.
