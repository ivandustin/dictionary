Etymology: The word "בהשפטו" (behashpato) is a Hebrew phrase composed of two parts. "ב" (be) means "in" or "during," and "השפטו" (hashpato) is the construct form of the noun "שפט" (shofet), which means "judge" or "judgment." Therefore, "בהשפטו" can be translated as "in his judgment" or "during his judgment."

Grammar: "בהשפטו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (be) indicates location or time, and it is followed by the construct form of the noun "שפט" (shofet). The construct form is used to indicate possession or association. In this case, it indicates that the judgment belongs to someone.

Description: "בהשפטו" is used in Hebrew to refer to a situation or event that occurs during a judgment or legal proceeding. It implies that the action or decision being discussed is related to the judgment or is taking place within the context of a legal process.
