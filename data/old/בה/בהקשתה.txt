Etymology: The word "בהקשתה" (behekshe'ta) is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts: "ב" (be), which means "in" or "with," and "הקשתה" (hekshe'ta), which is the feminine form of the verb "הקשית" (heksheet), meaning "to make difficult" or "to challenge." Therefore, "בהקשתה" can be translated as "in difficulty" or "with challenge."

Grammar: "בהקשתה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew, composed of the preposition "ב" (be) and the noun "הקשתה" (hekshe'ta). The preposition "ב" indicates a state or condition, and the noun "הקשתה" functions as the object of the preposition. In Hebrew grammar, the noun agrees in gender and number with the preposition, so "הקשתה" is the feminine singular form.

It can be used in various contexts, such as describing a difficult problem, a challenging project, or a demanding situation.
