Grammar: "חרפי" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: The word "חרפי" is used to describe something or someone that is disgraceful, shameful, or contemptible. It is often used to express strong disapproval or criticism towards a person, action, or behavior.
