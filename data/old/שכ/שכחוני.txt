Etymology: The word "שכחוני" comes from the Hebrew root "שכח" (sh.kh.kh), which means "to forget." The suffix "-וני" (-oni) indicates possession or belonging, so "שכחוני" can be translated as "my forgetfulness" or "my tendency to forget."

Grammar: "שכחוני" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. For example, "שכחונים" would be the plural form for masculine nouns, and "שכחוניות" would be the feminine singular form.

Description: "שכחוני" describes someone or something that tends to forget or has a tendency to be forgetful. It can be used to describe a person's forgetfulness or absent-mindedness.
