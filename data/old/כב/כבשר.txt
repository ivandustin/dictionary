Etymology: The word "כבשר" (pronounced "kav'sher") comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root כ-ב-שׁ (k-b-sh), which means "to conquer" or "to subdue."

Grammar: "כבשר" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to meat or flesh. It is commonly used in the context of food, specifically referring to the meat of animals that are permissible to eat according to Jewish dietary laws (kashrut).

Description: In Jewish dietary laws, the term "כבשר" is used to distinguish between kosher and non-kosher meat. Kosher meat must come from animals that have been slaughtered according to specific rituals and must not come from certain prohibited animals. The laws of kashrut also dictate how the meat is prepared and consumed.
