Etymology: The word "תפלון" comes from the Hebrew root פ.ל.ל (p.l.l), which means "to pray" or "to entreat." It is derived from the noun תְּפִלָּה (tefillah), which means "prayer."

Grammar: "תפלון" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is singular and can be used in both the definite and indefinite forms. In the plural form, it becomes "תפלונים" (tefillonim).

Description: "תפלון" refers to a set of small black leather boxes containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. These boxes are worn by observant Jewish men during morning prayers on weekdays. One box is worn on the arm, while the other is worn on the forehead. The purpose of wearing tefillin is to fulfill the commandment in the Torah to bind God's words as a sign upon the hand and between the eyes. Tefillin are considered a symbol of Jewish identity and devotion to God.
