Description: "תפארת" (Tiferet) is a concept in Jewish mysticism, particularly in the Kabbalah. It is one of the ten sefirot, which are divine emanations or attributes that represent different aspects of God's nature. Tiferet is associated with beauty, compassion, and harmony, and is often seen as a balance between the sefirot of Chesed (kindness) and Gevurah (severity). It is considered to be the central sefirah, representing the integration of all the other sefirot. In Kabbalistic teachings, Tiferet is seen as a divine quality that can be cultivated within oneself to bring about spiritual growth and enlightenment.
