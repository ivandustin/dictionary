Etymology: The word "תפעל" (tefa'al) comes from the Hebrew root פעל (pa'al), which means "to do" or "to act". The prefix ת (ta) indicates the future tense, so תפעל specifically refers to a verb in the future tense.

Grammar: תפעל is a verb form in the Hebrew language. It belongs to the binyan (verb structure) called "pa'al", which is one of the seven verb structures in Hebrew. The ת (ta) prefix indicates the future tense, and the root פעל (pa'al) provides the basic meaning of the verb.

Description: תפעל is used to express actions or events that will happen in the future. It is commonly used in modern Hebrew to talk about future plans, intentions, or predictions. For example, the sentence "אני אתפעל בסרט" (Ani etfa'al baseret) means "I will act in a movie".
