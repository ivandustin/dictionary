Description: Camels are known for their ability to survive in harsh desert environments. They have adapted to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. Camels are often used as pack animals and are known for their ability to carry heavy loads over long distances.

Camels also have long eyelashes and a third eyelid to protect their eyes from sand and dust.
