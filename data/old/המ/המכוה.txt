Etymology: The Hebrew word "המכוה" (hamakohah) comes from the root כ.ו.ה (k.w.h), which means "to strike" or "to hit". The prefix ה (ha) indicates "the", so המכוה literally means "the strike" or "the hit".

Grammar: המכוה is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to a specific strike or hit. It is a feminine noun, so it takes feminine singular forms in the sentence.

Description: המכוה can be used in various contexts, such as describing a physical blow or strike, or metaphorically to refer to a setback or a difficult situation. It can also be used to describe a punishment or a penalty.
