Description: In the Hebrew Bible, the sin offering (המחתה) was a specific type of sacrifice that was offered to atone for unintentional sins or ritual impurities. It was a way for individuals to seek forgiveness and restore their relationship with God. The sin offering involved the sacrifice of an animal, such as a bull, goat, or lamb, and the blood of the animal was sprinkled on the altar. The offering was then burned on the altar, symbolizing the removal of sin and the restoration of purity. The sin offering played an important role in the religious rituals and practices of ancient Israel.
