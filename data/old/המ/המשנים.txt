Description: "המשנים" (hamishanim) refers to a specific group of Jewish scholars who were active during the time of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. They were known for their extensive study and interpretation of Jewish law, as well as their contributions to the Mishnah, which is a compilation of Jewish oral traditions and teachings. The Mishnah is one of the foundational texts of Jewish law and serves as a basis for further legal discussions and interpretations. The Mishnah was compiled by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi (Judah the Prince) and his colleagues, including the Mishnaic scholars known as "המשנים" (hamishanim).
