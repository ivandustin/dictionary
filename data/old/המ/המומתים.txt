Etymology: The Hebrew word "המומתים" (hamomtim) is derived from the root מות (mut), which means "to die" or "to kill". The prefix ה- (ha) indicates "the", and the suffix ים (-im) is a plural masculine ending. Therefore, "המומתים" can be translated as "the dead" or "the killed".

Grammar: "המומתים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the root word מות (mut). The definite article ה- (ha) is used to indicate "the". In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they must agree with other words in a sentence.

Description: "המומתים" refers to a group of people who have died or have been killed. It can be used to describe deceased individuals in general or a specific group of people who have lost their lives due to a particular event or circumstance.
