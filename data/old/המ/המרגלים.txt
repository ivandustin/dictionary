Etymology: The Hebrew word "המרגלים" (hamraglim) is derived from the root ר.ג.ל (r.g.l), which means "to spy" or "to scout". The prefix ה (ha) means "the". Therefore, "המרגלים" translates to "the spies".

Grammar: "המרגלים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the root word. The definite article ה (ha) indicates that it is a specific group of spies.

Description: "המרגלים" refers to the group of spies sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan, as mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Numbers 13-14). These spies were chosen from each of the twelve tribes of Israel and were tasked with gathering information about the land and its inhabitants.
