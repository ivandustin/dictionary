Etymology: The word "המץ" (pronounced "hametz") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "מץ" (pronounced "matz"), which means "leaven" or "ferment." 

Grammar: "המץ" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to refer to leavened bread or any food product that contains leavening agents. It is commonly used during the Jewish holiday of Passover, where the consumption of leavened products is prohibited.

Description: "המץ" is a significant concept in Jewish culture and religion. During the holiday of Passover, Jews are required to remove all leavened products from their homes and consume only unleavened bread called "מצה" (pronounced "matzah"). The prohibition of leavened products during Passover symbolizes the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, as they did not have time to let their bread rise.
