Etymology: The word "הַמְקַדְּשִׁים" (HaMikdashim) is a Hebrew word that translates to "the sanctuaries" in English. It is derived from the root word "קָדַשׁ" (kadesh), which means "to sanctify" or "to make holy."

Grammar: "הַמְקַדְּשִׁים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the definite article "הַ" (ha) at the beginning, followed by the root word "מִקְדָּשׁ" (mikdash), which means "sanctuary" or "holy place," and the plural suffix "ִים" (-im).

Description: "הַמְקַדְּשִׁים" refers to the sanctuaries or holy places in Judaism. It is commonly used to refer to the two ancient temples in Jerusalem, known as the First Temple (built by King Solomon) and the Second Temple (rebuilt after the Babylonian exile). These temples were considered the central places of worship and sacrifice for the Jewish people. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to any sacred or holy places in Judaism.
