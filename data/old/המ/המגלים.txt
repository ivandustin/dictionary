Etymology: The word "המגלים" (HaMaggalim) is a Hebrew word that translates to "the spies" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root גלה (galah), which means "to reveal" or "to uncover."

Grammar: "המגלים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the singular form of the word, which is מגל (maggal).

Description: "המגלים" refers to a group of individuals who were sent by Moses to spy on the land of Canaan, as described in the Hebrew Bible (Numbers 13-14). These spies were chosen from each of the twelve tribes of Israel and were tasked with exploring the land and reporting back to Moses. However, most of the spies brought back a negative report, causing the Israelites to lose faith and resulting in their punishment of wandering in the wilderness for forty years.
