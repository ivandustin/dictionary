Description: The term "המעברות" (HaMa'abarot) refers to a series of transit camps that were established in Israel in the 1950s. These camps were initially intended to provide temporary housing for Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel after the establishment of the state. However, many of the immigrants ended up living in these camps for several years due to the lack of permanent housing options. The Ma'abarot played a significant role in the absorption and integration of immigrants into Israeli society during that period.
