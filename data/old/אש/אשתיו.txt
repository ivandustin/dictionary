Etymology: The word "אַשְׁתִּיוֹת" (Ash'tiyot) is a Hebrew word that means "grammatical genders" or "gendered nouns." It is derived from the root word "אִשָּׁה" (ishah), which means "woman" or "female."

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, nouns are classified into two genders: masculine and feminine. This classification is not based on biological gender but rather on grammatical rules. Masculine nouns usually end with a consonant, while feminine nouns often end with the vowel "ה" (heh). The concept of gendered nouns is an important aspect of Hebrew grammar and affects the agreement of adjectives, verbs, and pronouns.

Description: The concept of gendered nouns in Hebrew is unique and differs from many other languages. It is important to understand the gender of nouns in order to correctly use adjectives, verbs, and pronouns in Hebrew sentences. The gender of a noun is usually indicated by its form and ending, and it is an essential aspect of Hebrew grammar.
