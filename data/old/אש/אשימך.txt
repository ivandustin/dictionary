Etymology: The word "אשימך" (Ashimcha) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "שמך" (shemcha), which means "your name." The prefix "א" (aleph) in Hebrew is often used to indicate the possessive form, so "אשימך" can be translated as "I will put your name" or "I will make your name."

Grammar: "אשימך" is a verb in the future tense, first person singular form. It is derived from the root word "שים" (sim), which means "to put" or "to place." The prefix "א" (aleph) indicates the first person singular subject, and the suffix "ך" (cha) indicates the second person singular object.

Description: "אשימך" is used in Hebrew to express the act of putting or placing someone's name in a certain context. It can be used metaphorically to mean "I will make you famous" or "I will give you a good reputation." It can also be used literally to mean "I will write your name" or "I will mention your name."
