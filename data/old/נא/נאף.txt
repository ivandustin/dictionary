Etymology: The word "נאף" (na'af) comes from the Hebrew root נ.א.ף (n.a.f), which means "to commit adultery" or "to be unfaithful." 

Grammar: In Hebrew, נאף is a verb in the Qal (simple) conjugation. It is commonly used in the past tense, present tense, and future tense to describe the act of committing adultery or being unfaithful.

Description: נאף is a strong word in Hebrew that refers to the act of engaging in sexual relations with someone who is not one's spouse. It is considered a serious violation of the marital bond and is condemned in Jewish law and ethics. Adultery is seen as a breach of trust and a betrayal of the commitment made in marriage.
