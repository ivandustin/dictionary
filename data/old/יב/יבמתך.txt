Description: "יבמתך" refers to a woman who is eligible to enter into a levirate marriage. In Jewish law, if a man dies without leaving any children, his brother is obligated to marry the widow in order to continue the deceased brother's lineage. The woman in this context is referred to as "יבמתך" or "your yevama" in English.
