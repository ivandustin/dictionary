Etymology: The word "יבמה" (Yevamah) comes from the Hebrew root י-ב-ם (y-b-m), which means "to perform levirate marriage." It is derived from the biblical commandment of yibbum, which is the obligation of a man to marry his deceased brother's childless widow in order to continue his brother's lineage.

Grammar: "יבמה" (Yevamah) is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a woman who is eligible for levirate marriage, i.e., a widow whose husband died childless.

Description: In Jewish law, the concept of yibbum is discussed in the Torah (Deuteronomy 25:5-10) and is part of the laws of levirate marriage. If a married man dies childless, his brother is obligated to marry the widow and have children with her to continue the deceased brother's lineage. The child born from this union is considered the legal child of the deceased brother. If the brother refuses to marry the widow, a ceremony called chalitzah is performed, which releases the widow from the obligation of yibbum.
