Etymology: The word "יבמי" (Yevamot) is derived from the Hebrew root י-ב-ם (y-b-m), which means "to perform levirate marriage." Levirate marriage is a practice in which a man marries the widow of his deceased brother in order to continue his brother's lineage.

Grammar: "יבמי" is the plural form of the word "יבמה" (yevamah), which means "levirate widow" in Hebrew. It is used to refer to the tractate of the Talmud that discusses the laws and regulations related to levirate marriage.

Description: The tractate of Yevamot in the Talmud is one of the longest and most complex tractates, consisting of 122 pages. It covers various topics related to levirate marriage, including the obligations and rights of the levir (the brother-in-law), the status of the yevamah (the widow), and the rules regarding the children born from such marriages. The tractate also explores other related topics, such as forbidden marriages and the process of divorce.
