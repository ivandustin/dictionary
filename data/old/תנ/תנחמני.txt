Etymology: The word "תַּנְחוּמָנִי" (pronounced "tan-chu-ma-ni") is a Hebrew adjective derived from the root נ-ח-מ (n-ch-m), which means "to comfort" or "to console." The word is formed by adding the suffix נִי (-ni), which indicates possession or belonging. Therefore, "תַּנְחוּמָנִי" can be translated as "comforting" or "consoling."

Grammar: "תַּנְחוּמָנִי" is in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.
