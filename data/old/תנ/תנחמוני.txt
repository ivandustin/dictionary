Etymology: The word "תַּנְחוּמָנִי" (pronounced "tan-chu-ma-ni") is derived from the Hebrew root נָחַם (nacham), which means "to comfort" or "to console". The suffix נִי (ni) is added to the root to form an adjective, meaning "comforting" or "consoling".

Grammar: "תַּנְחוּמָנִי" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun being modified is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.
