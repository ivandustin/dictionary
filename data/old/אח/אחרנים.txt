Description: אחרנים is a term used in Jewish history and religious studies to refer to the later generations of Jewish scholars and rabbis who lived after the medieval period. These scholars made significant contributions to Jewish law, philosophy, and literature. They built upon the works of earlier Jewish sages and played a crucial role in shaping Jewish religious thought and practice. The term אחרנים is often used to distinguish these later scholars from the earlier authorities known as ראשונים (rishonim).
