Etymology: The word "חקים" (pronounced "chukim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root חקה (ch-k-h), which means "to engrave" or "to inscribe." It is derived from the noun חק (chok), which means "a statute" or "a decree."

Grammar: "חקים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It belongs to the masculine gender and is used to refer to laws, statutes, or decrees that are given by a higher authority.

Description: In Jewish tradition, "חקים" refers to a specific category of laws that are considered to be divine decrees. These laws are often seen as beyond human comprehension and are observed solely because they are commanded by God. They are distinct from "משפטים" (mishpatim), which are laws that can be understood by human reason.

In a broader sense, "חקים" can also refer to any set of laws or regulations that are considered to be binding and authoritative. It can be used to describe legal statutes, religious commandments, or any other type of prescribed rules.
