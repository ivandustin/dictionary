Etymology: The word "חקת" (pronounced "chokat") comes from the Hebrew root חקה (ch-k-h), which means "to engrave" or "to inscribe." It is derived from the noun חק (chok), which means "statute" or "law."

Grammar: "חקת" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a specific type of law or statute that is given by God in the Torah (the Hebrew Bible). In Hebrew grammar, it is classified as a "masculine noun with a feminine ending."

Description: In Jewish tradition, the term "חקת" is often used to refer to the laws and commandments that are considered to be beyond human comprehension. These laws are seen as divine decrees that are not necessarily based on rational or logical reasoning. The term is often used in the context of the laws of ritual purity and impurity, such as those related to the red heifer (חקת הפרה). These laws are seen as a test of faith and obedience to God's will.
