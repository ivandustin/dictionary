Etymology: The word "חקתי" (pronounced "chukati") is a Hebrew word derived from the root חקה (ch-k-h), which means "to engrave" or "to inscribe." It is related to the noun חק (chok), which means "statute" or "law."

Grammar: "חקתי" is the first-person singular form of the verb חקק (chakak), which means "to engrave" or "to inscribe." In this form, it means "I have engraved" or "I have inscribed." It is used in the context of a commandment or law that has been given by God and is to be followed by the Israelites.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Numbers (chapter 19, verse 2), the word "חקתי" is used to refer to the commandment of the red heifer. This commandment involves the ritual purification of individuals who have come into contact with a dead body. The ashes of a red heifer are mixed with water and used in a purification ceremony. The word "חקתי" emphasizes the divine origin and authority of this commandment.
