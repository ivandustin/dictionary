Etymology: The word "מהונך" (mahonach) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "הנך" (honach), which means "to rest" or "to settle." The prefix "מ" (m) in Hebrew often indicates a question or inquiry, so "מהונך" (mahonach) can be translated as "what is your rest?" or "where do you settle?"

Grammar: "מהונך" (mahonach) is a second-person singular masculine form in Hebrew. It is used to address a male individual and ask about their place of rest or settlement.

Description: "מהונך" (mahonach) is a poetic and somewhat archaic way of asking someone where they live or where they find their rest. It is not commonly used in modern Hebrew conversation, but it can still be found in literature or religious texts.
