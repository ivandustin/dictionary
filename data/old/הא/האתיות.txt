Description: "האתיות" refers to the vowels in the Hebrew language. Hebrew is a Semitic language that originally did not have written vowels. The vowels were added later to aid in pronunciation and to clarify the meaning of words. The system of vowels in Hebrew is called "ניקוד" (nikud). It consists of dots and lines that are placed above or below the consonants to indicate the vowel sounds. The vowels in Hebrew are important for proper pronunciation and understanding of the text.
