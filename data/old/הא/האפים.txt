Etymology: The word "האפים" (Ha'apim) is a Hebrew word that means "the nostrils" or "the nose." It is derived from the Hebrew root אפם (afam), which means "to breathe" or "to exhale."

Grammar: "האפים" (Ha'apim) is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the definite article "ה" (Ha) at the beginning of the word and the plural suffix "ים" (im) at the end. The definite article "ה" indicates that the noun is specific or known, and the plural suffix "ים" indicates that there is more than one nostril.

Description: "האפים" (Ha'apim) refers to the two openings in the nose through which air passes in and out of the respiratory system. Nostrils play a crucial role in breathing, as they help filter, warm, and moisten the air before it reaches the lungs. They also contribute to our sense of smell.
