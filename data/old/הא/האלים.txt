Etymology: The word "האלים" (Ha'alim) is a Hebrew word that means "the gods" or "the deities." It is derived from the Hebrew root אלה (aleph-lamed-heh), which means "god" or "deity."

Grammar: "האלים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the definite article "ה" (ha) at the beginning of the word and the plural suffix "-ים" (-im) at the end. The definite article "ה" indicates that the noun is specific and refers to a particular group of gods or deities.

Description: "האלים" is used in Hebrew to refer to gods or deities in a general sense. It can be found in various religious and mythological contexts, including the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), where it is often used to describe the gods of other nations or pagan deities. In monotheistic Judaism, the term is used to contrast the belief in the one true God with the worship of multiple gods or idols.
