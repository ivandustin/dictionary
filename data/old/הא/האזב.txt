Grammar: "האזב" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a specific type of insect, the wasp. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also have definite or indefinite forms.

Description: The wasp is an insect belonging to the order Hymenoptera and the suborder Apocrita. Wasps are known for their slender bodies, narrow waists, and often bright colors. They have two pairs of wings and a stinger, which they use for defense and hunting. Wasps are social insects, and some species build nests made of paper-like material. They are known for their ability to sting, and their sting can be painful and cause allergic reactions in some people. Wasps are important for ecosystem balance as they help control populations of other insects.
