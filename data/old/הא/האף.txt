Etymology: The word "האף" (Ha'af) is a Hebrew word that means "the nose." It is derived from the Hebrew root אף (af), which means "nose" or "snout."

Description: The nose is an essential part of the human body located in the center of the face. It is responsible for the sense of smell and plays a crucial role in the respiratory system by filtering, warming, and moistening the air we breathe. The nose is composed of bone, cartilage, and soft tissues, and it has two nostrils that lead to the nasal cavity. Inside the nasal cavity, there are tiny hairs and mucus membranes that help trap dust, bacteria, and other particles, preventing them from entering the lungs. The nose also contributes to our sense of taste, as the olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity work together with taste buds on the tongue to create the perception of flavor.
