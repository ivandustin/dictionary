Etymology: The word "מלאכה" (melacha) comes from the Hebrew root לאכ"ה, which means "to work" or "to labor". It is derived from the Hebrew word "מלאך" (malach), which means "messenger" or "angel". In Jewish tradition, the concept of melacha is associated with the work that was done in the construction of the Tabernacle in the wilderness.

Grammar: "מלאכה" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is usually used in the singular form, but can also be used in the plural form "מלאכות" (melachot).

Description: In Jewish law, "מלאכה" refers to the prohibited activities on the Sabbath (Shabbat) and certain holidays. These activities are based on the types of work that were done in the construction of the Tabernacle. The 39 categories of melacha include actions such as lighting a fire, cooking, sewing, and building. Observant Jews refrain from performing melacha on Shabbat and holidays as a way to honor and observe these sacred times.
