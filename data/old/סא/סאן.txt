Description: A tooth is a hard, calcified structure found in the jaws of many vertebrates. It is used for biting and chewing food, as well as for other functions such as speech and defense. Teeth are typically composed of a crown, which is the visible part above the gum line, and one or more roots, which anchor the tooth in the jawbone. Humans have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: the primary (baby) teeth, which are eventually replaced by the permanent (adult) teeth. Proper dental hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing, is important for maintaining healthy teeth and gums.
