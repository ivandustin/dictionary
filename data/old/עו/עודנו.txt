Etymology: The word "עודנו" (pronounced "odenu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ו.ד (Ayin-Vav-Dalet), which means "to add" or "to continue." It is derived from the Hebrew word "עוד" (od), which means "still" or "yet."

Grammar: "עודנו" is a compound word consisting of two parts: "עוד" (od) and "נו" (nu). The first part, "עוד," functions as an adverb meaning "still" or "yet." The second part, "נו," is a suffix that indicates the first-person plural possessive form, meaning "our." Therefore, "עודנו" can be translated as "our still" or "our yet."

Description: "עודנו" is used to express the idea of something that is still ongoing or continuing in the present. It implies that a certain situation or condition has not changed or ended yet. It can be used in various contexts, such as expressing hope, anticipation, or persistence.
