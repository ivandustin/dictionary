Description: "עוף" refers to any type of bird, including both domesticated and wild birds. Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by having feathers, beaks, and laying hard-shelled eggs. They are known for their ability to fly, although not all birds are capable of sustained flight. Birds play important roles in ecosystems, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and controlling insect populations. They are also admired for their beauty and are often kept as pets or studied by ornithologists.
