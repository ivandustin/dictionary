Etymology: The word "עולתיקם" (pronounced "olteikhem") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ל.ה (ayin-lamed-hei), which means "to ascend" or "to go up." The word is derived from the Hebrew noun עולה (oleh), which means "one who goes up" or "an ascent."

Grammar: "עולתיקם" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the singular form עולתיך (olteikha), which means "your ascent" or "your going up." The plural form is used to refer to multiple ascents or multiple instances of going up.

Description: "עולתיקם" is a term that is often used in Jewish religious contexts to refer to the offerings or sacrifices that were brought to the Temple in Jerusalem. These offerings were a central part of the religious rituals and were seen as a way for individuals to connect with God and seek forgiveness for their sins. The word can also be used more broadly to refer to any act of ascent or elevation, both literal and metaphorical.
