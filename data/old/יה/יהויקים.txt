Etymology: The word "יהוקים" (Yehoyakim) is a Hebrew name derived from the combination of two elements: "יהו" (Yeho), which is a shortened form of the divine name Yahweh, and "קים" (kim), which means "to rise" or "to establish." Therefore, the name Yehoyakim can be interpreted as "Yahweh establishes" or "Yahweh will raise up."

Grammar: "יהוקים" (Yehoyakim) is a masculine proper noun in Hebrew. It is written with five Hebrew letters: י (yod), ה (he), ו (vav), ק (qof), and י (yod). The first letter, י (yod), is a consonant that represents the sound /j/. The second letter, ה (he), is also a consonant that can represent the sounds /h/ or /a/. The third letter, ו (vav), is a consonant that represents the sound /v/ or /u/. The fourth letter, ק (qof), is a consonant that represents the sound /k/. The final letter, י (yod), is another consonant that represents the sound /i/. In Hebrew, the vowels are usually not written, but they are indicated by diacritic marks called "nikud."
