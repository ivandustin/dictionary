Etymology: The word "יהואש" (pronounced "Yehoash" in English) is a Hebrew name that has biblical origins. It is composed of two elements: "יהו" (Yeho), which is a shortened form of the divine name of God, and "אש" (ash), which means "fire" in Hebrew. Therefore, the name Yehoash can be translated as "God's fire" or "fire of God."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "יהואש" is a masculine proper noun. It is written with four Hebrew letters: י (yod), ה (he), ו (vav), and א (aleph). The name follows the pattern of many biblical Hebrew names, which often combine elements related to God with other words or concepts.

Description: Yehoash is a name that appears in the Hebrew Bible (2 Kings 11-12) and refers to a king of Judah who reigned during the 9th century BCE. He is known for his efforts to repair the Temple in Jerusalem and restore the worship of God. Yehoash is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in the New Testament (Matthew 1:7-8). Today, the name Yehoash is still used as a given name in Jewish communities.
