Etymology: The word "ישמעיהו" (Yeshma'iyahu) is a Hebrew name that is derived from the combination of two elements. The first element, "ישמע" (Yeshma'), is a form of the Hebrew verb "שמע" (shama'), which means "to hear" or "to listen." The second element, "יהו" (Yahu), is a shortened form of the Hebrew name for God, "יהוה" (Yahweh). Therefore, the name "ישמעיהו" can be translated as "Yahweh has heard" or "God listens."

Grammar: "ישמעיהו" is a proper noun in Hebrew and is used as a personal name. It follows the typical Hebrew pattern of combining a verb form with a divine element to create a name that expresses a religious or spiritual meaning.

Description: "ישמעיהו" is the Hebrew name for the prophet Isaiah, who is considered one of the major prophets in the Hebrew Bible. Isaiah's prophecies and teachings are recorded in the Book of Isaiah, which is an important text in both Judaism and Christianity. The name "ישמעיהו" reflects the belief that God heard Isaiah's prayers and messages, and that he was chosen by God to deliver important revelations to the people of Israel.
