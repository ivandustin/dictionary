Etymology: The word "ישברוהו" is a Hebrew word that consists of three parts: ישב (yashav) meaning "to sit," רוה (rohe) meaning "to break," and הו (hu) which is a pronoun meaning "it." When combined, the word ישברוהו means "it will break it" or "it will shatter it."

Grammar: ישברוהו is a verb in the future tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the root שבר (shavar), which means "to break" or "to shatter." The addition of the pronoun הו (hu) at the end of the word indicates that the action is being done to a third person singular object.

Description: ישברוהו is a strong and forceful word that conveys the idea of breaking or shattering something. It can be used metaphorically to describe the destruction or defeat of an object, concept, or idea.
