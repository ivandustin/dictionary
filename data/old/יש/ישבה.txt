Description: A Yeshiva is a traditional Jewish educational institution where students, typically young men, study Jewish texts and religious law. Yeshivas focus on the study of the Torah, Talmud, Jewish philosophy, and other religious texts. Students in a Yeshiva engage in intensive textual analysis and discussion, guided by experienced teachers known as Rabbis. Yeshivas can be found in Jewish communities worldwide and play a central role in the preservation and transmission of Jewish religious and cultural traditions.
