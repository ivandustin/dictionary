Etymology: The word "בְּנֵבָאיו" (pronounced "beneva'ayu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root בנה (b-n-h), which means "to build" or "to construct." The word is derived from the noun בֵּן (ben), which means "son," and the noun בַּיִת (bayit), which means "house." Therefore, "בְּנֵבָאיו" can be translated as "his sons' houses" or "the houses of his sons."

Grammar: In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word "בְּנֵבָאיו" is in the plural form, indicating that it refers to multiple houses. The word also includes a possessive suffix, "יו" (yu), which means "his." This indicates that the houses belong to someone.
