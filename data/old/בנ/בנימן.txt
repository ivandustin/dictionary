Etymology: The word "בְּנִימִין" (pronounced "Binyamin" in English) is a Hebrew name that originates from the Hebrew Bible. It is derived from the Hebrew words "בֵּן" (ben) meaning "son" and "יָמִין" (yamin) meaning "right hand" or "south." Therefore, "בְּנִימִין" can be translated as "son of the right hand" or "son of the south."

Grammar: "בְּנִימִין" is a masculine proper noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a person's name, specifically the name of one of the twelve sons of Jacob (also known as Israel) in the Hebrew Bible.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, Benjamin is the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel. He is the brother of Joseph and is known for being the father of one of the twelve tribes of Israel, the Tribe of Benjamin. Benjamin's descendants settled in the region of modern-day Israel known as the territory of Benjamin. The name "Benjamin" is still commonly used as a given name in Hebrew-speaking communities today.
