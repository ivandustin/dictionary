Etymology: The word "בַּנְקְרוֹת" (pronounced "bank'rot") comes from the Hebrew root ב־נ־ק־ר, which means "to break" or "to shatter." It is derived from the Aramaic word "בַּנְקַרְיָא" (bankarya) and the Greek word "βαγκροτίζω" (bankrotizo), both of which have the same meaning.

Grammar: "בַּנְקְרוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix וֹת (-ot) to the singular form בַּנְקֵר (banker). In Hebrew, nouns have gender, and "בַּנְקְרוֹת" is the feminine plural form.

Description: "בַּנְקְרוֹת" refers to bankruptcies or insolvencies. It is used to describe a financial situation in which a person or a company is unable to pay their debts and their assets are liquidated to repay creditors.
