Etymology: The word "בְּנוֹ" (pronounced "beno") is a Hebrew word that means "his son" or "son of him." It is derived from the Hebrew root בנה (pronounced "banah"), which means "to build" or "to establish."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "בְּנוֹ" is a possessive pronoun that is used to indicate possession or relationship. It is formed by combining the preposition "בְּ" (pronounced "be") meaning "in" or "with," and the noun "בֵּן" (pronounced "ben") meaning "son."

Description: "בְּנוֹ" is used in Hebrew to indicate that something belongs to or is related to a male person. It is commonly used to refer to a person's son. For example, if someone's name is David and you want to say "his son," you would say "בְּנוֹ שֶׁל דָּוִד" (pronounced "beno shel David"). This phrase means "the son of him who is David" or simply "David's son."
