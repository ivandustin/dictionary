Etymology: The word "בְּנֵיבַיִם" (pronounced "benevayim") is a Hebrew word that means "sons of the prophets." It is derived from the Hebrew root בנה (b-n-h), which means "to build" or "to establish," and the plural form of the word נָבִיא (navi), which means "prophet."

Grammar: "בְּנֵיבַיִם" is a masculine plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the plural suffix יִם (-im) to the singular form בֵּן (ben), which means "son." The prefix בְּ (be-) indicates the preposition "of" or "belonging to."

Description: The term "בְּנֵיבַיִם" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to a group of students or disciples of the prophets. It is often used to describe a group of young men who were being trained in the ways of prophecy and spiritual leadership. These "sons of the prophets" would learn from and serve alongside the prophets, preparing themselves for future ministry.
