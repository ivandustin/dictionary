Etymology: The word "לפוטיפר" (pronounced "lepotipar") is a Hebrew word that originates from the biblical story of Joseph and his brothers.

Pharaoh gives Joseph the Egyptian name "פוטיפר" (pronounced "potifar"), which means "he who belongs to the sun god Ra." The Hebrew word "לפוטיפר" is a combination of the preposition "ל" (meaning "to" or "belonging to") and the name "פוטיפר," indicating that something or someone belongs to or is associated with Potifar.
