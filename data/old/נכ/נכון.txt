Etymology: The word "נְקוּדָן" (Nekudan) comes from the Hebrew root נ-ק-ד (N-K-D), which means "to punctuate" or "to mark." It is derived from the noun נְקוּדָה (nekudah), meaning "dot" or "point."

Grammar: נְקוּדָן (Nekudan) is a noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a diacritic mark or vowel point that is added to Hebrew letters to indicate vowel sounds. These marks are essential for proper pronunciation and understanding of Hebrew texts.

Description: נְקוּדָן (Nekudan) is an integral part of the Hebrew writing system. It consists of a set of dots and lines that are placed above, below, or inside Hebrew letters to represent vowel sounds. Without these vowel points, Hebrew texts would be written using only consonants, making it difficult to read and understand. The use of נְקוּדָן (Nekudan) is particularly important in children's books, religious texts, and language learning materials.
