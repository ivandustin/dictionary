Etymology: The word "נְקֻדּוֹת" (Nekudot) comes from the Hebrew root נ.ק.ד (N.K.D), which means "to punctuate" or "to mark." It refers to the diacritical marks used in Hebrew writing to indicate vowel sounds.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, "נְקֻדּוֹת" (Nekudot) refers to the vowel points or diacritical marks that are added to the consonants in Hebrew script. These marks indicate the pronunciation of the vowels and help in reading and understanding the text.

Description: "נְקֻדּוֹת" (Nekudot) are essential in Hebrew writing as they provide the necessary vowel sounds to the consonants.
