Etymology: The word "נְקֻדְיִים" (Nekudot) is derived from the Hebrew root נ.ק.ד (N.K.D), which means "to punctuate" or "to mark." It refers to the diacritical marks used in Hebrew writing to indicate vowel sounds.

Grammar: In Hebrew grammar, "נְקֻדְיִים" (Nekudot) are the vowel points or diacritical marks that are added to the consonants to indicate the vowel sounds. These marks help in the pronunciation and reading of Hebrew texts.

Description: "נְקֻדְיִים" (Nekudot) are essential in Hebrew writing as they provide the necessary vowel sounds to the consonants. Without these marks, Hebrew texts would consist only of consonants, making it difficult to read and understand. The vowel points are placed above, below, or inside the consonants, and they indicate the specific vowel sound associated with each letter.
