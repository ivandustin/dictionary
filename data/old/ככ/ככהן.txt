Etymology: The word "ככהן" (pronounced "kohen") comes from the Hebrew root כֹּהֵן (k-h-n), which means "priest" or "minister." It is derived from the verb כָּהַן (kahan), which means "to serve" or "to minister."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "ככהן" is a noun that is used to refer to a male priest or a member of the priestly class. It is also used as a surname for individuals who are descendants of the priestly lineage. The word can be modified to indicate different forms, such as כֹּהֵן (kohen) for a singular male priest, כֹּהֲנִים (kohanim) for plural male priests, and כְּהֻנָּה (kehunah) for the priesthood as a whole.

Description: In Jewish tradition, the kohanim are descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, and they have specific religious duties and privileges. They are responsible for performing certain rituals in the Temple (in ancient times) and leading the prayers in synagogues. The kohanim are considered to be a distinct and honored group within the Jewish community.
