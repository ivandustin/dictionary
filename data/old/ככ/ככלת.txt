Grammar: "כִּכְלֵת" is a feminine noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word is also inflected for case, meaning it can change its form depending on its grammatical function in a sentence.

Description: "כִּכְלֵת" is a specific type of vessel or utensil mentioned in the Bible. It is often translated as "pan" or "frying pan" in English. The exact shape and size of a כִּכְלֵת are not specified in the biblical text, so its precise appearance is uncertain. However, it is generally understood to be a shallow, wide-mouthed cooking utensil used for frying or baking.
