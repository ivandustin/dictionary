Etymology: The word "ככפרים" (pronounced "kakafarim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כ-פ-ר, which means "to cover" or "to atone." It is derived from the noun כִּפֻּר (kipur), which means "atonement" or "covering."

Grammar: "ככפרים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (-im) to the singular form ככפר (kakafar). The plural form is used to refer to multiple atonements or coverings.

Description: "ככפרים" is a term used in Jewish religious context to refer to the two cherubim (angelic figures) that were placed on top of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies in the ancient Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. The cherubim were made of gold and their wings were spread out, covering the Ark. They were seen as symbols of God's presence and were associated with the atonement and forgiveness of sins.
