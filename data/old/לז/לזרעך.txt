Etymology: The word "לזרעך" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "זרע" (zera), which means "seed" or "sow". The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew indicates "to" or "for". Therefore, "לזרעך" can be translated as "to your seed" or "for your offspring".

Grammar: "לזרעך" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (lamed) indicates direction or purpose, and it is followed by the noun "זרעך" (zera'cha), which means "your seed" or "your offspring". In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are attached to the end of nouns, so "זרעך" indicates that the seed or offspring belongs to "you".

Description: "לזרעך" is a phrase that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), specifically in the book of Genesis. It is part of a promise made by God to Abraham, where God tells him that He will bless him and make his descendants numerous. The phrase is often translated as "to your offspring" or "for your descendants" in English. It signifies the future generations that will come from Abraham's lineage.
