Etymology: The word "לזרעו" (lazaro) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "זרע" (zera), which means "seed" or "sow". The prefix "ל" (lamed) in Hebrew indicates "to" or "for", so "לזרעו" can be translated as "to his seed" or "for his seed".

Grammar: "לזרעו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ל" (lamed) indicates direction or purpose, and it is followed by the noun "זרעו" (zera'o), which means "his seed" or "his offspring". The suffix "ו" (vav) indicates possession, so "זרעו" means "his seed" or "his offspring".

Description: "לזרעו" is a phrase that is often used in Hebrew to refer to someone's descendants or offspring. It can be used in a literal sense to talk about someone's biological children or in a figurative sense to talk about someone's spiritual or intellectual descendants.
