Etymology: The word "מעליו" (pronounced "ma'alav") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ל.ה (ayin-lamed-hey), which means "to ascend" or "to go up." The word is formed by adding the possessive suffix יו (yod-vav) to the root, indicating "his" or "its."

Grammar: "מעליו" is a masculine singular noun in Hebrew. It is composed of two parts: the preposition מ (mem), meaning "from" or "out of," and the noun עליו (alav), meaning "him" or "it." Together, they form the phrase "from him" or "from it."

Description: The word "מעליו" is used in Hebrew to indicate the source or origin of something. It is often translated as "from him" or "from it" in English. It can refer to a physical location or a figurative source. For example, if someone says "הגיע מעליו" (hegi'a ma'alav), it means "he arrived from him" or "he arrived from it," indicating that the person or thing came from a specific place or source.
