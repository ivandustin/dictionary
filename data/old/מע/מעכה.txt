Etymology: The word "מעכה" (ma'akah) comes from the Hebrew root ע.כ.ה (ayin.kaf.hei), which means "to grind" or "to crush." It is derived from the noun עֵכֶה (eke) meaning "millstone" or "grinding stone."

Grammar: "מעכה" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a millstone or a grinding stone.

Description: "מעכה" is an ancient tool used for grinding or crushing grains, seeds, or other substances. It consists of two circular stones, one on top of the other, with a space in between where the material to be ground is placed. The upper stone is turned by hand or by an animal, causing the lower stone to rotate and crush the material. Millstones were commonly used in ancient times for grinding wheat, barley, and other grains to make flour.
