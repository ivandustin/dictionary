Etymology: The word "מעלינו" (pronounced: ma'alino) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע-ל-ה (aleph-lamed-hei), which means "to ascend" or "to go up." The word is derived from the Hebrew phrase "עַלֵינוּ לְשַׁבֵּחַ" (alenu l'shabeach), which means "it is upon us to praise." 

Grammar: "מעלינו" is a Hebrew word that functions as a prepositional phrase. It consists of the preposition "מֵעַל" (me'al), which means "from above" or "over," and the pronoun suffix "נוּ" (nu), which means "us." Together, they form the phrase "מעלינו," which translates to "from above us" or "over us."

Description: The word "מעלינו" is often used in Jewish prayers and religious texts. It expresses the idea that it is our responsibility or duty to praise or give thanks to a higher power. It is commonly used in the phrase "עַלֵינוּ לְשַׁבֵּחַ" (alenu l'shabeach), which is part of the closing prayer of the Jewish prayer service. This phrase acknowledges the obligation to praise and glorify God.
