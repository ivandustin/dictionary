Grammar: "מעברה" (ma'abara) is a feminine noun in Hebrew.

In Hebrew grammar, the word "מעברה" (ma'abara) is declined according to the rules of feminine nouns.

Description: The term "מעברה" (ma'abara) is closely associated with the early years of the State of Israel, when large numbers of Jewish immigrants arrived from various countries. These transit camps were temporary settlements that provided housing and basic services for the new immigrants until they could be integrated into Israeli society. The conditions in the ma'abarot were often difficult, with overcrowding and limited resources. Over time, many of the ma'abarot were transformed into permanent towns and cities. The term "מעברה" (ma'abara) is now used to refer to this specific period in Israeli history and the unique challenges faced by the immigrants during that time.
