Etymology: The word "מעוריהם" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עור (ayin-vav-resh), which means "to awaken" or "to arouse". The suffix הם (hem) is a possessive pronoun meaning "their". Therefore, מעוריהם can be translated as "their awakenings" or "their arousals".

Grammar: מעוריהם is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns can be masculine or feminine, and they can be singular or plural. The plural form is used to indicate multiple instances of the noun. In this case, מעוריהם is the plural form of מעור (ma'or), which means "awakening" or "arousal". The suffix הם (hem) indicates possession, so מעוריהם means "their awakenings" or "their arousals".
