Etymology: The word "ברעהו" (pronounced "bar'ahu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "רעה" (pronounced "ra'ah"), which means "to shepherd" or "to tend to." The prefix "ב" (pronounced "be") in this word indicates "in" or "with." Therefore, "ברעהו" can be translated as "in his shepherding" or "with his tending."

Grammar: "ברעהו" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word "ב" is a preposition that means "in" or "with," and "רעהו" is a possessive noun that means "his shepherding" or "his tending." In Hebrew, possessive nouns are formed by adding the suffix "-ו" ("-hu") to the root word.

Description: "ברעהו" is a biblical Hebrew phrase that appears in Psalm 23:1, which is a well-known psalm attributed to King David.

It is a metaphorical expression that conveys the idea that God takes care of and provides for His people, just as a shepherd tends to and protects his flock. The phrase is used to express trust, reliance, and a sense of security in God's guidance and provision.
