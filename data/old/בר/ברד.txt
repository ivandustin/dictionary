Etymology: The word "ברד" (pronounced "barad") comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root ב-ר-ד, which means "to hail" or "to shoot." 

Grammar: In Hebrew, "ברד" is a noun that is used to describe a specific meteorological phenomenon - hail. It is a masculine noun and is typically used in the singular form. 

Description: Hail is a type of precipitation that consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice. It is formed when there are strong updrafts in thunderstorms that carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze. The frozen raindrops then accumulate layers of ice as they are carried up and down within the storm cloud. Eventually, the hailstones become too heavy for the updrafts to support, and they fall to the ground. Hail can vary in size, from small pellets to large stones, and can cause damage to crops, buildings, and vehicles.
