Etymology: The word "ברגליו" (pronounced "barglayv") is a Hebrew word that translates to "on his legs" or "with his legs." It is derived from the root word "רגל" (pronounced "regel"), which means "leg" in Hebrew.

Grammar: "ברגליו" is a phrase composed of two Hebrew words: "ב" (pronounced "b") meaning "on" or "with," and "רגליו" meaning "his legs." In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are attached to the noun they modify, so "רגליו" indicates that the legs belong to a male subject.

Description: "ברגליו" is used to describe someone or something that is standing or walking on their legs. It can be used to indicate physical movement or to describe a person's ability to walk or run.
