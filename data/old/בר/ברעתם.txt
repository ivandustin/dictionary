Etymology: The word "ברעתם" (pronounced "b're'atam") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "רעה" (pronounced "ra'ah"), which means "to shepherd" or "to tend to." The prefix "ב" (pronounced "be") means "in" or "with," and the suffix "תם" (pronounced "tam") is a possessive suffix that means "their." Therefore, "ברעתם" can be translated as "in their shepherding" or "with their tending to."
