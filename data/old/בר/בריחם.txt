Etymology: The word "בריחם" (pronounced "bri'cham") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-ר-ח (B-R-Ch), which means "to flee" or "to escape." The word is derived from the noun רחם (racham), which means "womb" or "compassion." The combination of these two roots gives the word בריחם the meaning of "escaping with compassion" or "fleeing with mercy."
