Etymology: The word "ברדת" (pronounced "baradet") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-ר-ד, which means "to hail" or "to pelt with hailstones". 

Grammar: "ברדת" is a noun in the feminine form. It is used to describe a specific type of weather phenomenon, namely hail. In Hebrew, nouns are typically formed by adding a suffix to the root of the word, and in this case, the suffix "-ת" is added to the root ב-ר-ד to form the noun "ברדת".

Description: "ברדת" refers to the precipitation of ice pellets or hailstones during a thunderstorm. Hailstones are formed when there are strong updrafts in a thunderstorm that carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze and form ice pellets. These ice pellets then grow in size as they are carried by the updrafts, until they become too heavy and fall to the ground as hailstones. Hail can vary in size, from small pellets to large stones, and can cause damage to crops, vehicles, and buildings.
