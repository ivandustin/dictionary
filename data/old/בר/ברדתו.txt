Description: "ברדתו" refers to the act of hailing or the occurrence of hail. Hail is a type of precipitation that consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice that fall from the sky during thunderstorms. It is formed when there are strong updrafts in a thunderstorm cloud that carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze and form ice pellets. Hailstones can vary in size, from small pebbles to large golf balls or even larger. Hailstorms can cause damage to crops, vehicles, and buildings.
