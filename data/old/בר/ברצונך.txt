Etymology: The word "ברצונך" (pronounced "birtzonecha") is a Hebrew word that translates to "according to your will" or "if you wish." It is derived from the root word "רצה" (ratza), which means "to desire" or "to want."

Grammar: "ברצונך" is a phrase composed of two parts: "ב" (pronounced "be") meaning "in" or "according to," and "רצונך" (pronounced "ratzonecha") meaning "your will" or "your desire." The word "רצונך" is a possessive form of the noun "רצון" (ratzon), which means "will" or "desire." The phrase is used to express someone's willingness or agreement to do something.

Description: "ברצונך" is a versatile phrase that can be used in various contexts. It is often used to politely ask someone if they would like or agree to do something. For example, if someone asks you "ברצונך לקפה?" (pronounced "birtzonecha lekafe?"), they are asking if you would like a coffee. It can also be used to express one's own willingness or agreement, such as saying "אני מסכים ברצוני" (pronounced "ani maschim birtzoni"), which means "I agree willingly."
