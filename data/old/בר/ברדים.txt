Etymology: The word "ברדים" (pronounced "baradim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-ר-ד, which means "hail" in Hebrew.

Grammar: "ברדים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is the plural form of "ברד" (pronounced "barad"), which means "hailstone" in Hebrew. In Hebrew grammar, plural nouns are formed by adding the suffix "-ים" (-im) to the singular form of the noun.

Description: "ברדים" refers to hailstones, which are solid balls or irregular lumps of ice that fall from the sky during a hailstorm. Hailstones are formed when updrafts in thunderstorms carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, causing them to freeze into ice pellets. Hailstones can vary in size, from small pebbles to large chunks of ice. They can cause damage to crops, buildings, and vehicles when they fall with enough force.
