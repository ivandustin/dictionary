Etymology: The word "ברוח" (pronounced "b'ruach") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-ר-ח (bet-resh-chet), which means "to flee" or "to escape." It is derived from the noun רוח (ruach), which means "wind" or "spirit."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "ברוח" is a prepositional phrase that consists of the preposition "ב" (pronounced "b") meaning "in" or "with," and the noun "רוח" (pronounced "ruach") meaning "wind" or "spirit." Together, it means "in the wind" or "with the wind."

Description: The word "ברוח" is often used metaphorically to describe a state of freedom or liberation. It can refer to a feeling of being carried away by the wind or being free from constraints. It can also be used to describe a sense of spontaneity or going with the flow.
