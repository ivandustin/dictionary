Etymology: The word "טלאים" (pronounced "talaim") is a Hebrew word that means "dewdrops" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root ט.ל.א (T.L.A), which means "to moisten" or "to wet".

Grammar: "טלאים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ים" (-im) to the singular form of the word, which is "טל" (tal).

Description: "טלאים" refers to small drops of water that form on surfaces during the night when the temperature drops and the air becomes saturated with moisture. Dewdrops are commonly seen on plants, grass, and other objects in the early morning. They are formed when the temperature of the surface cools down, causing the moisture in the air to condense and form tiny droplets. Dewdrops are often associated with freshness and beauty, and they play an important role in the water cycle and the growth of plants.
