Etymology: The word "הכליות" (HaKlayot) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "כלי" (kli), which means "vessel" or "container". The suffix "-ות" (-ot) is a plural form in Hebrew, so "הכליות" (HaKlayot) means "the kidneys" in English.

Grammar: "הכליות" (HaKlayot) is a noun in Hebrew and it is in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have different forms for singular and plural, and "הכליות" (HaKlayot) is the plural form of "הכליה" (HaKlayah), which means "the kidney" in singular.

Description: The kidneys are a pair of organs located in the back of the abdomen, on either side of the spine. They play a crucial role in filtering waste products and excess fluid from the blood, producing urine, and maintaining the body's electrolyte balance. The kidneys also help regulate blood pressure and produce hormones that stimulate the production of red blood cells.
