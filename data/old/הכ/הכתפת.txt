Etymology: The word "הכתפת" (haketafet) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כ-ת-פ, which means "to shoulder" or "to bear." It is derived from the noun כתף (katef), which means "shoulder."

Grammar: "הכתפת" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a specific type of shoulder covering or shoulder strap that is worn as part of traditional Jewish prayer garments, such as the tallit (prayer shawl) or tefillin (phylacteries).

Description: The "הכתפת" is a decorative strip of fabric or leather that is attached to the corners of the tallit or tefillin.
