Etymology: The word "הכתבים" (HaKetavim) is a Hebrew word that means "the writings" or "the scriptures." It is derived from the Hebrew root כתב (k-t-v), which means "to write."

Grammar: "הכתבים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ים (im) to the singular form הכתב (HaKetav). In Hebrew, nouns have gender, and "הכתבים" is masculine.

Description: "הכתבים" refers to a specific collection of books in the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament. These books include Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. They are considered to be the writings of various authors and are distinct from the Torah (the first five books of the Bible) and the Nevi'im (the Prophets). The Ketuvim are often referred to as the "Writings" or the "Hagiographa" in English.
