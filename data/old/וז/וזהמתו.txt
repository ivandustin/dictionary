Grammar: "וֶזְהַמְּתוֹ" (vezehamto) is a compound word formed by combining the conjunction "וְ" (ve) with the noun "זֶה־הַמְּתוֹ" (zeh hamto). In Hebrew, compound words are formed by combining two or more words to create a new word with a different meaning.

Description: "וֶזְהַמְּתוֹ" (vezehamto) is a phrase used in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 12:23) to describe the final plague that struck Egypt, resulting in the death of the firstborn. It is often translated as "and this is the death" or "and this is how death will come." The phrase is significant in the context of the Passover story, as it marks the moment when the Israelites were spared from the plague by following God's instructions to mark their doorposts with the blood of a lamb.
