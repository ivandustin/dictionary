Etymology: The word "חיתני" (pronounced "chitni") comes from the Hebrew root ח.ת.נ (ch.t.n), which means "to cover" or "to protect." It is derived from the noun חיתן (chitan), which means "a covering" or "a garment."

Grammar: "חיתני" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender, number, and definiteness with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is feminine, plural, or definite, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description: "חיתני" is used to describe something or someone that is protective or covering. It can refer to a physical covering, such as a garment or a shield, or it can be used metaphorically to describe someone who provides protection or support.
