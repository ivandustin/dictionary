Etymology: The word "צלעתיו" (tsela'otav) is a Hebrew word derived from the root צלע (ts-l-'a), which means "side" or "rib". The suffix תיו (tav-yod-vav) indicates possession, so צלעתיו literally means "his sides" or "his ribs".

Grammar: צלעתיו is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The masculine plural form of צלעתיו is used to refer to the sides or ribs of a male person or animal.

Description: צלעתיו is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to describe the creation of Eve from Adam's rib. It is mentioned in Genesis 2:21-22: "So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man." This story is symbolic and represents the creation of woman as a companion and helper for man.
