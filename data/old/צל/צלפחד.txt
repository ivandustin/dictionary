Description: In the Bible, Tzelafchad was a member of the tribe of Manasseh. He had five daughters and no sons. When the Israelites were preparing to enter the Promised Land, Tzelafchad's daughters approached Moses and requested that they be given their father's inheritance since he had no sons. Their request was granted, and a new law was established to allow daughters to inherit their father's property if there were no sons. The story of Tzelafchad and his daughters is found in the book of Numbers, chapter 27.
