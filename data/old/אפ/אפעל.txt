Etymology: The word "אפעל" (pronounced "af'al") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פעל (pa'al), which means "to do" or "to act". The prefix א (aleph) in this case indicates the causative form, so אפעל can be translated as "to cause to act" or "to make someone do".

Grammar: אפעל is a verb in the Hebrew language. It belongs to the binyan Pa'al, which is one of the seven verb patterns in Hebrew. The binyan Pa'al is used to describe actions in the active voice, where the subject performs the action.

Description: אפעל is used to express the act of causing someone to do something or making someone perform an action. It is often used in a causative sense, indicating that the subject is causing or making someone else do something. For example, "אני אפעל את הילד ללמוד" (I make the child study).
