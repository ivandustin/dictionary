Grammar: התקדרו is a verb in the past tense, third person plural form. In Hebrew, verbs are conjugated according to tense, person, and number. The prefix הת (hata) indicates the reflexive form of the verb, and the suffix ו (u) indicates the past tense, third person plural form.

Description: התקדרו is used to describe the action of something or someone becoming dark or darkening itself. It can be used in a literal sense, such as when the sky becomes dark during the evening, or in a figurative sense, such as when someone's mood darkens.
