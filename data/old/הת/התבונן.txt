Etymology: The Hebrew word "התבונן" (hithbonen) comes from the root בנה (banah), which means "to build" or "to construct." The prefix הת- (hit-) indicates reflexive action, so התבונן can be understood as "to build oneself" or "to construct oneself."

Grammar: התבונן is a verb in the Hebrew language. It is in the reflexive form, indicating that the subject is performing the action on itself. It is conjugated in the present tense, third person singular form.

Description: התבונן is often translated as "to contemplate" or "to meditate." It refers to the act of deep thinking or reflection, often with the intention of gaining insight or understanding. It can also imply a sense of self-examination or introspection.
