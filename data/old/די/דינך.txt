Etymology: The word "דינך" (pronounced "dincha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ד-י-ן (D-Y-N), which means "to judge" or "to rule." It is derived from the Hebrew noun "דין" (din), which means "judgment" or "law."

Grammar: "דינך" is a Hebrew word that functions as a possessive pronoun in the second person singular. It is used to indicate possession or ownership, similar to the English word "your." It is formed by combining the preposition "ד" (d) meaning "of" or "your," and the noun "דין" (din) meaning "judgment" or "law."

Description: "דינך" is a word that is commonly used in Hebrew to address someone directly and indicate possession. It is often used in formal or respectful contexts when speaking to someone. For example, if you want to say "your book" in Hebrew, you would say "ספרך" (sefercha), where "ספר" (sefer) means "book" and "ך" (cha) is the possessive pronoun suffix for the second person singular.
