Description: "אמקן" (amkan) is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a legal document that serves as a guarantee or collateral for a loan. It is typically a written agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the amount borrowed, the repayment schedule, and any interest or penalties. The amkan is often signed by both the borrower and the lender, and it is considered a binding contract. In case of default, the lender can use the amkan to collect the debt or seize the collateral specified in the document.
