Etymology: The word "תורתי" (Torati) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "תורה" (Torah), which means "law" or "instruction." It is derived from the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Five Books of Moses, which are considered the foundational texts of Judaism.

Grammar: "תורתי" is a Hebrew adjective that means "my Torah" or "my law." It is formed by adding the possessive suffix "-י" (my) to the noun "תורה" (Torah). In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify, so "תורתי" is the masculine singular form. The feminine singular form is "תורתי" (Torati), and the plural forms are "תורתי" (Toratay) for masculine and "תורתי" (Torotay) for feminine.

Description: "תורתי" is a term used to express a personal connection or ownership of the Torah.
