Etymology: The word "ראני" (pronounced "ra'ani") is a Hebrew word that means "my shepherd" or "my guide." It is derived from the Hebrew root ראה (ra'ah), which means "to see" or "to behold." In the context of the word ראני, it refers to a shepherd who watches over and guides his flock.

Grammar: ראני is a possessive form of the word רעה (ra'ah), which means "shepherd" or "guide." The suffix ני (ni) is added to indicate possession, similar to the English possessive pronoun "my." So, ראני translates to "my shepherd" or "my guide."

Description: ראני is a term used in Hebrew to express a personal relationship between an individual and their shepherd or guide. It conveys a sense of trust, protection, and guidance. In religious and poetic contexts, it is often used metaphorically to refer to God as the ultimate shepherd or guide of the people.
