Etymology: The word "שאול" (pronounced "Sha'ul") is a Hebrew name that has its roots in the Hebrew Bible. It is derived from the Hebrew verb "שאל" (sha'al), which means "to ask" or "to inquire."

Grammar: "שאול" is a masculine proper noun in Hebrew. It is typically used as a given name for boys. In Hebrew grammar, it follows the pattern of a regular noun with a definite article, so it can be preceded by the definite article "ה" (ha), meaning "the," to form "השאול" (haSha'ul), which translates to "the Sha'ul."

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, "שאול" is the name of the first king of Israel. He is commonly known as King Saul in English. Saul was anointed as king by the prophet Samuel, but his reign was marked by both successes and failures. He is remembered for his military victories against the enemies of Israel, but also for his disobedience to God's commands. The story of Saul's life and reign is recorded in the First Book of Samuel in the Hebrew Bible.
