Etymology: The word "וְנַאֲכְלָהוּ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root נ.א.כל (n.a.kh.l), which means "to eat." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix הוּ (hu) is a third-person masculine singular pronoun, meaning "him." Therefore, the word וְנַאֲכְלָהוּ (ve-na'akh-lahu) can be translated as "and we will eat him."

Grammar: וְנַאֲכְלָהוּ (ve-na'akh-lahu) is a verb form in the future tense, first-person plural, and masculine singular object. It is used when the speaker or writer is referring to a group of people (we) who will eat a masculine singular object (him).

Description: וְנַאֲכְלָהוּ (ve-na'akh-lahu) is a phrase that can be found in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 37:20). It is part of a conversation between Joseph's brothers, who were planning to harm him. The phrase is used to express their intention to kill Joseph and eat him metaphorically, indicating their extreme anger and jealousy towards him.
