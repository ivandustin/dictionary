Etymology: The word "וְנִתְנָאֵל" (pronounced "V'Nitan'el") is a Hebrew name that consists of two parts. The first part, "וְ" (pronounced "v'"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "נִתְנָאֵל" (pronounced "Nitan'el"), is a compound name made up of two elements: "נָתַן" (pronounced "na'tan"), which means "to give," and "אֵל" (pronounced "el"), which is a shortened form of "אֵלוֹהַּ" (pronounced "e'lo'ah"), meaning "God." Therefore, the name "וְנִתְנָאֵל" can be translated as "and God has given" or "God has given."

Grammar: "וְנִתְנָאֵל" is a masculine Hebrew name that follows the pattern of verb + subject. The verb "נָתַן" (to give) is conjugated in the past tense, third person singular form, and the subject is "אֵל" (God).
