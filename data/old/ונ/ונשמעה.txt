Etymology: The word "ונשמעה" (pronounced "v'nishma'ah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root "נ-ש-מע" (n-sh-m-a), which means "to hear" or "to listen." The prefix "ו" (vav) in front of the root indicates the future tense, making the word mean "and it shall be heard" or "and it shall be listened to."

Grammar: "ונשמעה" is a verb in the future tense, third person singular form. It is conjugated from the root "נ-ש-מע" (n-sh-m-a), with the addition of the prefix "ו" (vav) to indicate the future tense. The suffix "ה" (he) at the end of the word indicates the third person singular form.

Description: "ונשמעה" is a biblical Hebrew phrase that appears in the Torah, specifically in the book of Deuteronomy (Devarim) 6:4. It is part of the Shema, a central prayer in Judaism. The full phrase is "שמע ישראל ה' אלהינו ה' אחד" (Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad), which translates to "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One." "ונשמעה" is the last word of this phrase and means "and it shall be heard" or "and it shall be listened to." It emphasizes the importance of actively listening and internalizing the message of the Shema.
