Etymology: The word "וְנַאֲכְלָנוּ" (pronounced "vena'achlenu") is a Hebrew verb form derived from the root נ.א.כ.ל (N.A.Kh.L), which means "to eat." The prefix וְ (ve) indicates the conjunction "and," and the suffix נוּ (nu) indicates the first-person plural object pronoun "us." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and we will eat us" or "and we will eat ourselves."

Grammar: "וְנַאֲכְלָנוּ" is a future tense verb form in the first-person plural. It is conjugated in the binyan (verb structure) called Nif'al, which is used for passive or reflexive actions. The verb root נ.א.כ.ל (N.A.Kh.L) is modified to fit the Nif'al structure, resulting in נַאֲכֵל (na'akhel) for the base form. The suffix נוּ (nu) is added to indicate the first-person plural object pronoun "us."

Description: "וְנַאֲכְלָנוּ" is a verb form that expresses the action of eating in the future tense, with the subject being the first-person plural "us."

The Nif'al structure suggests a passive or reflexive action, indicating that the group will eat themselves or be eaten by something/someone else.
