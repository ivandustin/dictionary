Etymology: The word "כחכה" (pronounced "kachkaha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כ-ח-כ, which means "to grind" or "to crush." It is derived from the noun כחכה, which refers to a millstone used for grinding grain.

Grammar: כחכה is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to describe a specific type of millstone used in ancient times. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also be declined for case (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.) and state (definite or indefinite).

Description: כחכה is a heavy stone tool used for grinding grain into flour. It consists of two circular stones, one on top of the other, with a hole in the center. The upper stone is turned by a handle or a lever, causing it to rotate and grind the grain against the lower stone. This process was commonly used in ancient times for preparing flour for baking bread.
