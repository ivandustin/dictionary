Etymology: The word "לכהנים" (l'kohanim) is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root word "כהן" (kohen), which means "priest" in English. 

Grammar: "לכהנים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the prefix "ל" (l') which means "to" or "for" and the suffix "ים" (im) which indicates the plural form. 

Description: "לכהנים" is used to refer to the priests in Judaism, specifically the descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. In Jewish tradition, the kohanim have specific religious duties and privileges, including performing certain rituals in the Temple and reciting the priestly blessing. The word can also be used more broadly to refer to individuals who are descendants of the priestly line.
