Etymology: The word "בעדו" (pronounced "ba'ado") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "ב" (pronounced "be"), is a preposition meaning "in" or "with." The second part, "עדו" (pronounced "ado"), is a noun derived from the root עד (pronounced "ad"), which means "until" or "up to." Therefore, "בעדו" can be translated as "in his/her/its until" or "with his/her/its until."

The preposition "ב" (pronounced "be") indicates a relationship of location or possession, and the noun "עדו" (pronounced "ado") functions as the object of the preposition. The noun "עדו" is in the third person singular possessive form, indicating that it refers to a male or gender-neutral possessive pronoun.
