Etymology: The word "בעצו" (pronounced "ba'atzu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עצה (atzah), which means "to advise" or "to counsel." The prefix ב (ba) means "in" or "with," so בעצו can be translated as "with his advice" or "with his counsel."

Grammar: בעצו is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word ב (ba) is a preposition that indicates "in" or "with," and עצו (atzo) is a possessive pronoun that means "his advice" or "his counsel." In Hebrew, the possessive pronoun agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies.

Description: בעצו is used to describe someone who acts or makes decisions based on their own advice or counsel. It implies that the person is self-reliant and independent in their decision-making process.
