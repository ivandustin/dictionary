The prefix בְּ (be) indicates "in" or "with," and the suffix תְּרָה (terah) is a feminine form indicating a state or condition. Therefore, the word בְּעֶשְׂתְּרָה can be translated as "in a state of ten" or "with ten."

Description: בְּעֶשְׂתְּרָה is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a situation where a woman is married to two men simultaneously. This concept is derived from the biblical story of Tamar, who was married to two brothers, Er and Onan, after the death of her first husband. In Jewish law, בְּעֶשְׂתְּרָה is considered a forbidden and invalid marital status.
