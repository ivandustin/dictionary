Etymology: The word "בְּעוֹתִיךְ" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ו.ת (Ayin-Vav-Tet), which means "to sign" or "to mark." It is derived from the noun עוֹת (ot), which means "sign" or "mark."

Grammar: "בְּעוֹתִיךְ" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition בְּ (be) means "in" or "with," and the noun עוֹתִיךְ (otich) is the plural form of עוֹת (ot), meaning "signs" or "marks." The suffix יִךְ (-ich) indicates the second person feminine singular possessive form, so the literal translation of "בְּעוֹתִיךְ" is "in your signs" or "with your marks."

Description: "בְּעוֹתִיךְ" can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. It can refer to physical signs or marks on a person's body, such as scars or tattoos. It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone's unique characteristics or distinguishing features.
