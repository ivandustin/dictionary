Etymology: The word "בעלתך" is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "בעל" (ba'al), means "owner" or "possessor." The second part, "תך" (tech), is a possessive suffix that indicates possession by a female. Therefore, "בעלתך" can be translated as "your female owner" or "your female possessor."

Grammar: "בעלתך" is a noun in the feminine form. It is formed by adding the possessive suffix "תך" to the noun "בעל." In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can be modified by possessive suffixes to indicate possession.

Description: The word "בעלתך" is used to refer to a female owner or possessor. It can be used in various contexts, such as describing a woman who owns something or has control over something. The word is commonly used in modern Hebrew to refer to a female spouse or partner.
