Etymology: The word "בעשיו" (pronounced "be'ashiyu") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root letters ע-ש-ו (Ayin-Shin-Vav). It is derived from the verb "עשה" (asah), which means "to do" or "to make." The prefix "ב" (be) means "in" or "with." Therefore, "בעשיו" can be translated as "in his doing" or "with his making."

Grammar: "בעשיו" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The preposition "ב" (be) means "in" or "with," and "עשיו" is the possessive form of the pronoun "he" or "his." It is used to indicate possession or association.

Description: "בעשיו" is used in Hebrew to describe something that is done or made by someone. It can refer to a specific action or creation that belongs to a particular person. For example, "בעשיו שלי" (be'ashiyu sheli) means "in my doing" or "with my making," indicating that something was done or made by the speaker.
