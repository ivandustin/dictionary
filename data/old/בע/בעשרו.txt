Etymology: The word "בעשרו" (pronounced "be'asuro") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ש.ר (A.S.R), which means "to count" or "to number." The prefix ב (be) means "in" or "with," so בעשרו literally means "in his ten" or "with his ten."

Grammar: בעשרו is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word ב (be) is a preposition that means "in" or "with," and עשרו (asuro) is the possessive form of the noun עשר (eser), which means "ten." The possessive form indicates that the ten belongs to someone or something.

Description: בעשרו is used in Hebrew to indicate possession or ownership of something. It is often used to describe someone's age, as in "בעשרו שנים" (be'asuro shanim), which means "at the age of ten." It can also be used to describe someone's possessions, such as "בעשרו ידים" (be'asuro yadim), which means "with his ten hands."
