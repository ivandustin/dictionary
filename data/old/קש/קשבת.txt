Etymology: The word "קֶשֶׁבֶת" (keshet) comes from the Hebrew root ק־ש־ב, which means "to bow" or "to arch." It is related to the word קֶשֶׁת (keshet), which means "bow" as in a weapon.

Grammar: קֶשֶׁבֶת is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to a rainbow, which is a natural phenomenon that occurs when sunlight is refracted, reflected, and dispersed in water droplets, creating a spectrum of colors in the sky.

Description: The rainbow is often described as a semicircular arc of colors, typically consisting of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It is formed when sunlight passes through raindrops in the air, causing the light to bend and separate into its component colors. The rainbow is a symbol of hope and beauty in many cultures and is often associated with positive emotions and harmony.
