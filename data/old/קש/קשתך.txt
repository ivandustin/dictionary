Etymology: The word "קֵשֶׁת" (keshet) comes from the Hebrew root ק.ש.ת (k.sh.t), which means "to bend" or "to arch." It is related to the Aramaic word קַשְׁתָּא (qashta) and the Arabic word قَوْس (qaws), both of which also mean "bow."

Grammar: In Hebrew, קֵשֶׁת is a feminine noun. It is usually used in the singular form, but it can also be used in the plural form קְשָׁתוֹת (keshatot). It can function as both a subject and an object in a sentence.

Description: קֵשֶׁת refers to a bow, a weapon used for shooting arrows. It consists of a flexible arc with a string stretched between its two ends. The bowstring is pulled back and released to propel the arrow forward. The קֵשֶׁת has been used for hunting, warfare, and sport throughout history. It is also a symbol of strength, power, and precision.
