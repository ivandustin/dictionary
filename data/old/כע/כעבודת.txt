Etymology: The word "כְּעֵבוֹדָה" (ke'avodah) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עבד (avad), which means "to serve" or "to worship." The prefix כְּ (ke) means "like" or "as," so כְּעֵבוֹדָה can be translated as "like service" or "as worship."

Grammar: כְּעֵבוֹדָה is a noun in the singular form. It is feminine and can be used with definite or indefinite articles, such as הַכְּעֵבוֹדָה (the service) or כְּעֵבוֹדָה אַחַת (one service).

Description: כְּעֵבוֹדָה is often used in the context of religious or spiritual worship. It can refer to the act of serving or worshiping a higher power, such as God, and can encompass various rituals, prayers, and ceremonies. In Judaism, כְּעֵבוֹדָה specifically refers to the service performed in the Temple in Jerusalem, which included sacrifices, offerings, and other religious practices. Today, it can also be used more broadly to describe any form of religious or spiritual service or worship.
