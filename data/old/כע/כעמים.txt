Etymology: The word "כְּעֵמִים" (pronounced "ke'emim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עמ"מ, which means "to gather" or "to assemble." It is derived from the noun עֵם (am), which means "people" or "nation."

Grammar: "כְּעֵמִים" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word כְּ (ke) means "like" or "as," and עֵמִים (e'emim) is the plural form of the noun עַם (am), meaning "people" or "nations." Together, the phrase means "like nations" or "as nations."

Description: The phrase "כְּעֵמִים" is used in Hebrew to compare or liken something to nations. It is often used to emphasize the magnitude or significance of a particular action or event. For example, it can be used to describe a gathering or assembly of people that is large or important, similar to how nations come together for significant events.
