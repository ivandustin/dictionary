Etymology: The word "כְּעִמְרָה" (pronounced "ke'imrah") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עמר (amr), which means "to bind" or "to gather." It is derived from the noun עֹמֶר (omer), which refers to a sheaf of grain that is bound together.

Grammar: כְּעִמְרָה is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew. The word כְּ (ke) means "like" or "as," and עִמְרָה (imrah) is the noun form of the root עמר (amr), meaning "binding" or "gathering." Together, כְּעִמְרָה can be translated as "like a sheaf" or "as a bundle."

Description: כְּעִמְרָה is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to describe various things that are bound or gathered together. It can refer to a bundle of grain, as in the context of the harvest festival of Shavuot, where an omer of grain was brought as an offering. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a group of people or a collection of things that are united or connected in some way.
