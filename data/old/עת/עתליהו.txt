Etymology: The word "עתליהו" (Etalyahu) is a Hebrew name of biblical origin. It is composed of two elements: "עת" (et), meaning "time" or "season," and "יהו" (Yahu), a shortened form of the divine name "יהוה" (Yahweh). Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "Yahweh is my time" or "Yahweh is my season."

Grammar: "עתליהו" (Etalyahu) is a masculine Hebrew name. It is formed by combining the root "עתל" (etel) with the suffix "-יהו" (-yahu), which is a common element in Hebrew names referring to God. The name is spelled with the Hebrew letters ע (ayin), ת (tav), ל (lamed), י (yod), ה (hey), and ו (vav).
