Etymology: The word "עֵתָם" (etam) comes from the Hebrew language. It is derived from the root ע.ת.ם (ayin.tet.mem), which means "to seal" or "to close." 

Grammar: "עֵתָם" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe a seal or a signet ring. It is also used metaphorically to refer to something that is closed or hidden.

Description: In ancient times, seals or signet rings were used to authenticate documents or to mark ownership. They were typically made of stone or metal and had a unique design or inscription. The seal would be pressed into wax or clay to leave an impression, indicating that the document or object was genuine or belonged to a specific person. The word "עֵתָם" is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe both physical seals and metaphorical seals, representing something that is hidden or closed off.
