Etymology: The word "זרעיו" (pronounced "zera'av") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ז.ר.ע (z.r.a), which means "to sow" or "to plant." It is derived from the noun זֶרַע (zera), which means "seed."

Grammar: "זרעיו" is a masculine plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix יו (yav) to the root זרע (zera). The suffix יו indicates possession, so "זרעיו" means "his seeds" or "its seeds."

Description: "זרעיו" refers to the seeds of a plant or the reproductive part of a plant that is used for propagation. Seeds contain the genetic material necessary for the growth and development of a new plant. They are typically enclosed in a protective outer covering and can be dispersed by various means, such as wind, water, or animals. Seeds play a crucial role in the reproduction and survival of plants.
