Etymology: The word "פילגשי" (pronounced "pilegeshi") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root word "פ.ל.ג.ש" which means "to serve" or "to wait on." It is derived from the noun "פֶּלֶגֶשׁ" (pilegesh) which refers to a concubine or a secondary wife in ancient Hebrew culture.

Grammar: "פילגשי" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is in the plural form and is used to refer to multiple concubines or secondary wives.

Description: In ancient Hebrew culture, a "פילגש" (pilegesh) was a woman who had a lower status than a wife but higher than a servant. She was considered a secondary wife or a concubine and had a less formal and legal relationship with the man compared to a wife. The practice of having concubines was more common in ancient times but is not prevalent in modern Hebrew culture.
