Etymology: The word "פילגשים" (pronounced "pilegeshim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root פ.ל.ג.ש (P.L.G.SH), which means "to serve" or "to wait on." It is derived from the noun פֶּלֶגֶשׁ (pilegesh), which refers to a concubine or a secondary wife in ancient Hebrew society.

Grammar: "פילגשים" is the plural form of the word פֶּלֶגֶשׁ (pilegesh). In Hebrew, nouns have different forms for singular and plural. The word is masculine and plural, indicating that it refers to multiple concubines or secondary wives.

Description: In ancient Hebrew society, a פֶּלֶגֶשׁ (pilegesh) was a woman who had a lower status than a wife but higher than a servant. She was often taken as a secondary wife by a man, usually with the consent of his first wife. While a wife had legal rights and social status, a פֶּלֶגֶשׁ (pilegesh) had fewer rights and was not considered equal to a wife. The practice of having concubines was more common in ancient times and is not widely practiced today.
