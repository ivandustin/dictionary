Etymology: The word "פילגש" (pronounced "pilegesh") is a Hebrew term that originates from the Hebrew Bible. It is derived from the root word "פ.ל.ג" (p.l.g), which means "to divide" or "to separate." 

Grammar: In Hebrew, "פילגש" is a noun that refers to a concubine or a secondary wife. It is a feminine noun and is used to describe a woman who is in a lower status than a full wife but higher than a mistress or a servant.

Description: In ancient times, having a concubine was a common practice in many cultures, including ancient Hebrew society. A concubine was a woman who lived with a man and had a lower status than a full wife. While she had certain rights and privileges, she did not have the same legal and social status as a wife. The term "פילגש" is used in the Hebrew Bible to describe women who were in such relationships.
