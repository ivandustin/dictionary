Etymology: The word "מִצְרֵימָה" (pronounced "mitzraymah" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root צ־ר־מ, which means "to bind" or "to restrict." It is formed by adding the suffix -ה (-ah) to the root, which indicates direction or destination.

Grammar: "מִצְרֵימָה" is a prepositional phrase in Hebrew, consisting of the preposition מִן (min), meaning "from," and the noun צְרֵימָה (tzraymah), meaning "Egypt." The preposition מִן indicates movement or origin, and in this case, it signifies movement from a place, specifically from Egypt.

Description: "מִצְרֵימָה" is used to indicate movement or direction towards Egypt. It is commonly used in biblical and modern Hebrew to express the idea of going or coming to Egypt.
