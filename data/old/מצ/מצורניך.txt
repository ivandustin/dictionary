Etymology: The word "מְצוֹרְנִית" (m'tzornit) is derived from the Hebrew root צ.ר.נ (ts.r.n), which means "to besiege" or "to surround". It is formed by adding the suffix ית (-it) to the root.

Grammar: "מְצוֹרְנִית" is a feminine noun in Hebrew. It is used to describe a specific type of grammatical structure known as a construct state. In Hebrew, nouns can be in either a definite or indefinite state, and the construct state is used to indicate a possessive relationship between two nouns.

Description: In Hebrew grammar, the construct state is used to connect two nouns together, with the first noun modifying or describing the second noun. The construct state is formed by adding the suffix ת (-it) to the end of the first noun. For example, the phrase "בֵּית הַסֵּפֶר" (beit ha-sefer) means "the school", where "בֵּית" (beit) means "house" and "הַסֵּפֶר" (ha-sefer) means "the book". In the construct state, "בֵּית" (beit) becomes "בֵּית הַסֵּפֶר" (beit ha-sefer), meaning "the house of the book" or "the book's house".

In summary, "מְצוֹרְנִית" is a Hebrew word that refers to the construct state in grammar, which is used to indicate a possessive relationship between two nouns.
