Etymology: The word "מְצוֹרָע" (pronounced "metzora") comes from the Hebrew root צָרַע (tsara) which means "to be struck with leprosy" or "to be afflicted with a skin disease." 

Grammar: "מְצוֹרָע" is a noun in the masculine form. It is in the singular form, but can also be used in the plural form "מְצוֹרָעִים" (metzora'im). 

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Leviticus, the term "מְצוֹרָע" refers to a person who has been afflicted with a skin disease, commonly translated as leprosy. The condition of being a "מְצוֹרָע" had significant religious and social implications in ancient Israelite society. The affected person was considered ritually impure and had to undergo a purification process before being allowed to rejoin the community.
