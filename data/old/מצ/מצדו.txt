Etymology: The word "מצדו" (pronounced "matzdo") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root צדה (tsada), which means "to hunt" or "to pursue". It is derived from the noun צד (tsad), which means "side" or "edge". In this context, מצדו means "from his side" or "from his edge".

Grammar: מצדו is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts: the preposition מ (pronounced "mi"), which means "from", and the noun צדו (pronounced "tsado"), which means "his side" or "his edge". The suffix ו (pronounced "o") indicates possession, meaning "his".

It can be used in a literal sense, such as referring to something that physically comes from the side of a person or object. It can also be used metaphorically to describe something that is associated with or originates from someone's perspective, viewpoint, or position.
