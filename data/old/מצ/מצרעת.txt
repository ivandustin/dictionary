Etymology: The word "מִצְרֵעַת" (metsora'at) comes from the Hebrew root צָרַע (tsara') which means "to be afflicted" or "to be struck with a skin disease." 

Grammar: "מִצְרֵעַת" is a noun in the feminine singular form. It is derived from the root צָרַע (tsara') and is used to describe a specific skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, "מִצְרֵעַת" refers to a skin disease known as "leprosy" in English translations. However, it is important to note that the biblical term encompasses a broader range of skin conditions than what is commonly understood as leprosy today. The disease was considered a serious affliction and those affected were required to undergo a period of isolation and purification.
