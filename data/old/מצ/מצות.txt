Etymology: The word "מְצוֹת" (matsot) is of Hebrew origin. It comes from the root צ.ו.ה (ts.w.h), which means "to command" or "to decree."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "מְצוֹת" (matsot) is a noun in the plural form. It is derived from the singular form "מִצְוָה" (mitzvah), which means "commandment" or "good deed."

Description: "מְצוֹת" (matsot) refers to unleavened bread or matzah, which is traditionally eaten during the Jewish holiday of Passover. It is a flat, thin, and crisp bread made without yeast or leavening agents. The consumption of matzah during Passover commemorates the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, as they did not have time to let their bread rise. Matzah is also symbolic of humility and the removal of leavened products (chametz) from the home during the holiday.
