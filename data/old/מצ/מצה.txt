Description: Matzah is a type of flatbread that is traditionally eaten during the Jewish holiday of Passover. It is made from flour and water, and it is baked quickly without allowing it to rise. Matzah is an important symbol of the Jewish exodus from Egypt, as it represents the unleavened bread that the Israelites ate when they left Egypt in haste. It is also a reminder of the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, as they did not have time to wait for the bread to rise. Matzah is typically thin and crisp, and it has a distinct texture and taste. It is often used in various Passover dishes and is a central element of the Passover Seder meal.
