Etymology: The word "מִצְרֵעַתוֹ" (mitzre'ato) is a Hebrew word derived from the root צ-ר-ע (ts-r-a), which means "to be afflicted" or "to be struck with a skin disease." It is related to the noun מְצֹרָע (metzora), which refers to a person afflicted with a specific skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

Grammar: "מִצְרֵעַתוֹ" is a noun in the Hebrew language. It is formed by adding the suffix תוֹ (-to) to the root צ-ר-ע (ts-r-a). The suffix תוֹ (-to) indicates possession, so the word can be translated as "his affliction" or "his skin disease."

Description: "מִצְרֵעַתוֹ" refers to the affliction or skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the book of Leviticus. This disease, commonly translated as "leprosy," was considered a serious condition that required isolation and purification rituals. The term is used to describe both the disease itself and the person who is afflicted with it.
