Description: "מְצוֹתִיו" is a term used in Judaism to refer to the commandments or precepts given by God in the Torah. These commandments are considered to be binding obligations for Jewish individuals and communities. The term encompasses a wide range of religious, ethical, and ritual obligations, including both positive commandments (mitzvot aseh) and negative commandments (mitzvot lo ta'aseh).
