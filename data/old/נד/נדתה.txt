Etymology: The word "נְדָה" (niddah) comes from the Hebrew root נדה (n-d-h), which means "to be impure" or "to menstruate." 

Grammar: נְדָה is a noun in the feminine gender. It is used to refer to a woman who is in a state of ritual impurity due to menstruation.

Description: In Jewish law, נְדָה refers to the state of ritual impurity that a woman enters during her menstrual cycle. During this time, a woman is considered impure and is required to abstain from certain activities, such as physical contact with her husband and entering certain areas of the home or synagogue. The laws of נְדָה are an important aspect of Jewish family purity laws and are observed by Orthodox and some Conservative Jewish communities.
