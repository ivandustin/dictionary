Grammar: "קוצותיו" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix ות (ot) to the root קוץ (kotz), and the suffix יו (av) indicates possession. The word is used to refer to the thorns or prickles of a plant.

Description: "קוצותיו" is used to describe the sharp, pointed structures that grow on the stems or branches of certain plants.

They can be found on various types of plants, such as roses, cacti, and thistles.
