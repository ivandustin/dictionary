Grammar: In Hebrew, "פסח" (Pesach) is a noun that can be used as a verb as well. It is typically used in the masculine form, but can also be used in the feminine form as "פסחה" (Pesachah).

Description: Pesach is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It is also known as Passover. The holiday lasts for seven or eight days, during which Jews refrain from eating leavened bread (chametz) and instead eat unleavened bread (matzah). The highlight of the holiday is the Seder, a festive meal that includes the retelling of the Exodus story and the consumption of symbolic foods. Pesach is considered one of the most important holidays in the Jewish calendar.
