Etymology: The word "יושבתי" is derived from the Hebrew root י-ש-ב, which means "to sit". The suffix תי (-ti) indicates the first person singular possessive form, meaning "my". Therefore, יושבתי (yosheveti) translates to "my sitting" or "my sitting place".

Grammar: יושבתי is a feminine noun in the singular form. It is formed by adding the suffix תי (-ti) to the root י-ש-ב. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The feminine form is used when referring to a female subject or when the noun itself is inherently feminine.

Description: יושבתי can be used to describe a physical place where someone sits or a figurative place of residence or position. It can also refer to the act of sitting or the state of being seated. The exact meaning and usage of יושבתי may vary depending on the context in which it is used.
