Description: "גרנה" is a term that is primarily used in the context of ancient agricultural practices. It refers to the process of separating the edible part of the grain from the inedible husk. This was typically done by beating the harvested grain with a tool called a "גרן" to loosen the husk and then using the wind to blow away the lighter chaff while the heavier grain fell to the ground. The term can also be used metaphorically to describe any process of separating or distinguishing between different elements.
