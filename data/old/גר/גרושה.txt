Description: "גרושה" is a term used in Jewish law to refer to a woman who has been divorced or separated from her husband. In Jewish tradition, divorce is allowed under certain circumstances, and a get (a religious divorce document) is required for the divorce to be valid. Once a woman receives a get, she is considered a גרושה. This term is also used in modern Hebrew to refer to a divorced or separated woman in general.
