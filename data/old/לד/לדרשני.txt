Etymology: The word "לְדַרְשֵׁנִי" (ledarsheni) is a Hebrew phrase that consists of two parts. The first part, "לְ" (le), is a preposition that means "to" or "for." The second part, "דַּרְשֵׁנִי" (darsheni), is a verb derived from the root ד-ר-ש (d-r-sh), which means "to seek" or "to inquire." Therefore, the literal translation of "לְדַרְשֵׁנִי" is "to seek me" or "to inquire of me."
