Etymology: The word "וָעִינָפִיה" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ענפ (ayin-nun-peh), which means "branch" or "twig". The prefix וְ (vav) means "and", and the suffix יָה (yod-heh) is a possessive form that means "her". So, the word literally means "and her branch" or "and her twig".

Grammar: The word "וָעִינָפִיה" is a noun in the feminine singular form. It is composed of the conjunction וְ (vav) and the noun עִינָפִיה (ayin-nun-peh-yod-heh). In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). In this case, the noun is feminine singular.

Description: The word "וָעִינָפִיה" is not commonly used in modern Hebrew. It appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in the book of Ezekiel (17:6) as a metaphorical description of a vine. The word is used to describe the branch or twig of a vine, symbolizing growth and prosperity.
