Etymology: The word "וָעֳדָרוֹ" (pronounced "va'adoro") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root עדר (pronounced "adar"), which means "to flock" or "to gather." The prefix וָ (pronounced "va") means "and." Therefore, the word וָעֳדָרוֹ can be translated as "and his flock" or "and his gathering."

Grammar: וָעֳדָרוֹ is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word וָ (va) is a conjunction meaning "and," and עֳדָרוֹ (adoro) is the possessive form of the noun עֵדֶר (eder), which means "flock" or "herd." The possessive form indicates that the flock belongs to someone or something.

Description: וָעֳדָרוֹ is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to a person's flock or herd of animals, typically sheep or goats. It can also be used metaphorically to represent a group of people or followers. The word emphasizes the idea of gathering or collecting animals or people together.
