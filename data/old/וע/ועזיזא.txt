Etymology: The word "וָעֶזְרָא" (pronounced "ve'ezra") is a Hebrew name that originated from the Hebrew Bible. It is composed of two elements: "וָ" (pronounced "va"), meaning "and," and "עֶזְרָא" (pronounced "ezra"), which is a Hebrew name meaning "help" or "assistance."

Grammar: "וָעֶזְרָא" is a masculine Hebrew name. In Hebrew, names can have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. For example, if used as a subject, it would be "עֶזְרָא" (Ezra) without the prefix "וָ" (va).

Description: "וָעֶזְרָא" is a biblical name that is primarily associated with the figure of Ezra in the Hebrew Bible. Ezra was a scribe and priest who played a significant role in the restoration of Jerusalem and the reestablishment of Jewish religious practices after the Babylonian exile. The name "וָעֶזְרָא" is often given to boys in Jewish communities as a way to honor this biblical figure and to symbolize the hope for divine assistance and guidance.
