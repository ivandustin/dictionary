Etymology: The word "וָעִינִיו" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.י.נ (Ayin-Yod-Nun), which means "to see" or "to perceive." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the suffix יוֹ (yod-vav) indicates possession or ownership. Therefore, the word can be translated as "and his eyes" or "and his vision."

Grammar: "וָעִינִיו" is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The prefix וְ (vav) connects it to another word or phrase, and עֵינַיִם (ayinayim) is the plural form of עַיִן (ayin), which means "eye." The suffix יוֹ (yod-vav) indicates possession, so וָעִינִיו (vayinav) means "and his eyes."

Description: וָעִינִיו (vayinav) is used in Hebrew to describe someone's eyes or vision. It can refer to the physical eyes or metaphorically represent someone's ability to perceive or understand.
