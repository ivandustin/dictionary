Etymology: The word "וָעֹדוֹ" (pronounced "va'odo") is a Hebrew word that consists of two parts. The first part, "וָ" (pronounced "va"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "עֹדוֹ" (pronounced "odo"), is a noun derived from the root עד (pronounced "ad"), which means "until" or "still." Therefore, "וָעֹדוֹ" can be translated as "and still" or "and until."

Grammar: "וָעֹדוֹ" is a combination of the conjunction "וָ" and the noun "עֹדוֹ." In Hebrew, the conjunction "וָ" is used to connect words or phrases, similar to the English word "and." The noun "עֹדוֹ" is in the masculine singular form, indicating that it refers to a singular masculine object or concept.

Description: The word "וָעֹדוֹ" is often used in Hebrew to express the idea of continuity or ongoingness. It can be used to indicate that something is still happening or will continue to happen in the future. It can also be used to emphasize the persistence or duration of a certain state or action.
