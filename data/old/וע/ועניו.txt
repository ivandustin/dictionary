Etymology: The word "וָעֳנִיו" (pronounced "va'aniyav") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עני (ani), which means "poor" or "needy". The prefix וָ (va) means "and". Therefore, the word וָעֳנִיו can be translated as "and his poor" or "and his needy".

Grammar: וָעֳנִיו is a noun phrase in Hebrew. The word וָ (va) is a conjunction that means "and", and עֳנִיו (aniyav) is the possessive form of the noun עָנִי (ani), meaning "his poor" or "his needy". In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, so the form of the word עֳנִיו (aniyav) will change depending on the gender and number of the possessor.

Description: וָעֳנִיו is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to someone who is poor or needy. It can be used to describe someone who lacks material possessions or someone who is in a state of distress or suffering. The word is often used in a compassionate or empathetic context, emphasizing the need to help and support those who are less fortunate.
