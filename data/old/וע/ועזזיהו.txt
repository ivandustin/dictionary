Etymology: The word "וָעֶזֶזִיְהוּ" (pronounced "va'ezzeziyu") is a Hebrew name that combines two elements. The first part, "וָ" (pronounced "va"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "עֶזֶזִיְהוּ" (pronounced "ezzeziyu"), is a name derived from the Hebrew word "עֵז" (pronounced "ez"), which means "goat" or "strong." The name can be interpreted as "and the strength of Yahweh" or "and Yahweh is strong."

However, since "וָעֶזֶזִיְהוּ" is a proper noun, it does not change its form based on these grammatical features.
