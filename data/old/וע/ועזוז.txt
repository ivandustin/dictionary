Etymology: The word "וָעֶזֶב" (pronounced "va'ezev") is a Hebrew word that means "and a wolf." It is derived from the Hebrew root ע.ז.ב (ayin-zayin-bet), which means "wolf."

Grammar: "וָעֶזֶב" is a noun phrase composed of the conjunction "וָ" (va), meaning "and," and the noun "עֶזֶב" (ezev), meaning "wolf." In Hebrew, nouns are typically inflected for gender, number, and definiteness. However, "עֶזֶב" is an irregular noun that does not change its form based on these grammatical features.

Description: "וָעֶזֶב" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to a wolf. Wolves are carnivorous mammals that belong to the Canidae family. They are known for their social behavior and hunting skills. In biblical times, wolves were often seen as symbols of danger, cunning, and destruction.
