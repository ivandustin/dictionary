Etymology: The word "וָעֳבִדְיָהוּ" (pronounced "va'ovidyahu") is a Hebrew name composed of two elements. The first part, "וָ" (pronounced "va"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "עֳבִדְיָהוּ" (pronounced "ovidyahu"), is a combination of two Hebrew words: "עֶבֶד" (pronounced "eved"), meaning "servant" or "slave," and "יָהוּ" (pronounced "yahu"), which is a shortened form of the divine name of God, "יהוה" (pronounced "Yahweh" or "Jehovah"). Therefore, the name "וָעֳבִדְיָהוּ" can be translated as "and the servant of Yahweh" or "and the slave of Jehovah."

Grammar: "וָעֳבִדְיָהוּ" is a masculine Hebrew name. The conjunction "וָ" (va) is used to connect the name with another word or phrase. The word "עֳבִדְיָהוּ" (ovidyahu) is a combination of the noun "עֶבֶד" (eved) and the divine name "יָהוּ" (yahu). In Hebrew grammar, names can be composed of multiple elements and can have various meanings.
