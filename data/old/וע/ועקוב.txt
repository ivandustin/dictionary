Etymology: The word "וָעֵקוֹב" (pronounced "va'eekov" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root עקב (ayin-kuf-bet), which means "heel" or "to follow closely." It is derived from the story in the book of Genesis where Jacob is born holding onto his twin brother Esau's heel.

Grammar: "וָעֵקוֹב" is a Hebrew noun that means "heel" or "foot." It is in the singular masculine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural).

Description: "וָעֵקוֹב" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the physical heel or foot. It can also be used metaphorically to mean "following closely" or "trailing behind." In the story of Jacob and Esau, the name Jacob (Ya'akov in Hebrew) is derived from the same root and is associated with the idea of "heel" or "supplanter," as Jacob was born holding onto Esau's heel and later deceived him to receive his birthright.
