Etymology: The word "וָעִינִית" (pronounced "va'init") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.נ.ה (Ayin-Nun-Hey), which means "to answer" or "to respond." The prefix וְ (pronounced "ve") means "and," and the suffix יִת (pronounced "eet") indicates the feminine form of the word. Therefore, וָעִינִית can be translated as "and she answered" or "and she responded."

Grammar: וָעִינִית is a verb in the past tense, third person, feminine singular form. In Hebrew, verbs change their form based on the gender, number, and tense of the subject. The prefix וְ (ve) indicates the conjunction "and," connecting the verb to a previous action or statement.

Description: וָעִינִית is used to describe a female subject who answered or responded to something. It can be used in various contexts, such as in a narrative or dialogue, to indicate that a female character replied to a question, statement, or request.
