Etymology: The word "וָעַבְדּוֹם" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עבד (Ayin-Bet-Dalet), which means "to serve" or "to work." The prefix וְ (vav) means "and," and the suffix וֹם (vav-vav-mem) is a noun-forming suffix that denotes a person or a group of people. Therefore, וָעַבְדּוֹם can be translated as "and the servants" or "and the workers."

Grammar: וָעַבְדּוֹם is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The plural form is used to indicate more than one person or thing. In this case, וָעַבְדּוֹם refers to a group of people who serve or work.

Description: וָעַבְדּוֹם is a word that is often used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to servants or workers. It can be used to describe individuals who serve in various capacities, such as servants in a household, workers in a field, or laborers in a community. The word carries the connotation of someone who performs tasks or duties for others.
