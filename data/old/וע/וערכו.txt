Etymology: The word "וָעָרְבוּ" (pronounced "va'arvu") is a Hebrew verb that comes from the root ערב (ayin-resh-bet), meaning "to mix" or "to blend." It is derived from the noun עֵרֶב (erev), which means "evening" or "dusk."

Grammar: "וָעָרְבוּ" is a verb in the past tense, third person plural form. The prefix "וָ" (va-) indicates the conjunction "and," and the root ערב (ayin-resh-bet) is conjugated in the past tense with the suffix "-וּ" (-u) to indicate the third person plural.

Description: "וָעָרְבוּ" is found in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 1:24) and is translated as "and they mixed" or "and they blended." It refers to the act of various species of animals mixing or blending together.
