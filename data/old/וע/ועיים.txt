Etymology: The word "וָעִידִים" (pronounced "va'idim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ו.ד (Ayin-Vav-Dalet), which means "to bear witness" or "to testify." The prefix וְ (pronounced "ve") means "and," and the suffix יִים (pronounced "im") is a plural ending. Therefore, "וָעִידִים" can be translated as "and witnesses" or "and testimonies."

Grammar: "וָעִידִים" is a masculine plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the plural suffix יִים to the singular form עֵד (pronounced "ed"), which means "witness" or "testimony." In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also have different forms depending on their function in a sentence (e.g., subject, object, possessive).

Description: "וָעִידִים" refers to witnesses or testimonies. In a legal context, it can refer to people who provide evidence or testimony in a court of law. In a broader sense, it can also refer to any form of evidence or testimony that supports a claim or statement. The word can be used both literally and metaphorically, depending on the context.
