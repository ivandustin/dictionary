Etymology: The word "וָעֹרִיו" (pronounced "va'oriyo") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ערה (pronounced "arah"), which means "to uncover" or "to reveal." The prefix וָ (pronounced "va") means "and," and the suffix יו (pronounced "yo") is a possessive pronoun meaning "his." Therefore, the word וָעֹרִיו can be translated as "and his nakedness" or "and his uncovering."

Grammar: וָעֹרִיו is a noun phrase composed of the conjunction וָ (meaning "and") and the noun עֹרִיו (meaning "his nakedness" or "his uncovering"). In Hebrew, nouns have gender and number, and they can be declined to indicate possession, as in this case with the suffix יו (meaning "his"). The word וָעֹרִיו is in the masculine singular form.

Description: וָעֹרִיו is a biblical Hebrew term that appears in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in various contexts. It is often used to refer to the exposure of one's nakedness or the act of uncovering oneself. In some instances, it is used metaphorically to describe shame or disgrace. The term is commonly found in narratives and laws related to sexual morality and modesty.
