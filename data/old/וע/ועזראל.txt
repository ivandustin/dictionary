Etymology: The word "וָעֶזְרָאֵל" (pronounced "ve'ezra'el") is a Hebrew name composed of two elements. The first part, "וָ" (pronounced "va"), is a conjunction meaning "and." The second part, "עֶזְרָאֵל" (pronounced "ezra'el"), is a combination of two Hebrew words: "עֶזֶר" (pronounced "ezer") meaning "help" or "assistance," and "אֵל" (pronounced "el") meaning "God." Therefore, the name "וָעֶזְרָאֵל" can be translated as "and God is my help" or "God has helped."
