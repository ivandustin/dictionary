Etymology: The word "וָעֹלִים" (pronounced "va'olim") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root עָלָה (alah), which means "to go up" or "to ascend." The prefix וָ (va) means "and," so the word וָעֹלִים can be translated as "and they go up" or "and they ascend."

Grammar: וָעֹלִים is a plural noun in the masculine gender. It is derived from the verb עָלָה (alah) in the present tense, indicating an ongoing action. The suffix יִם (im) is a common plural ending in Hebrew.

Description: וָעֹלִים is often used in the context of Jewish religious practices, specifically referring to the offerings that were brought to the Temple in Jerusalem. These offerings were considered to be a way for individuals to draw closer to God and express their devotion. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to any act of ascending or going up, both physically and metaphorically.
