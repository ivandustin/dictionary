Etymology: The word "וָעֹרוֹת" (pronounced "va'orot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.ר.ה (ayin, resh, hey), which means "to be naked" or "to be bare."

Grammar: "וָעֹרוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the suffix וֹת (ot) to the root ע.ר.ה (ayin, resh, hey). The prefix וָ (va) indicates the conjunction "and," which connects the noun to another word or phrase.

Description: "וָעֹרוֹת" refers to "skins" or "hides" in Hebrew. It is commonly used in the Bible to describe the skins of animals, particularly in the context of clothing or coverings. For example, in the story of Adam and Eve, after they sinned, they realized they were naked and made "וָעֹרוֹת" (skins) to cover themselves.
