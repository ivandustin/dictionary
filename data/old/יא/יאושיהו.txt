Etymology: The word "יאושיהו" (pronounced "Ya'ushiyahu" in Hebrew) is a Hebrew name that is derived from the combination of two elements. The first element, "יאו" (pronounced "Ya'o"), is a shortened form of the divine name "יהוה" (pronounced "Yahweh" or "Yehovah"). The second element, "שיהו" (pronounced "shiyahu"), means "Yahweh is salvation" or "Yahweh has saved." Therefore, the name "יאושיהו" can be translated as "Yahweh has saved" or "Yahweh is salvation."

Grammar: "יאושיהו" is a proper noun in Hebrew and is used as a personal name. It follows the typical Hebrew pattern of combining a divine element with a descriptive element to form a name. In Hebrew grammar, it is classified as a masculine name.

Description: In the Hebrew Bible, "יאושיהו" refers to a king of Judah who reigned from approximately 640 to 609 BCE.

"יאושיהו" is considered a righteous king who sought to restore proper worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry in the kingdom. He is mentioned in several biblical books, including 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, and the Book of Jeremiah.
