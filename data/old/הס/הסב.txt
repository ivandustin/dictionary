Description: The lion is a large carnivorous mammal that belongs to the Felidae family. It is known for its majestic appearance, with a muscular body, a large head, and a mane around its neck. Lions are native to Africa and are known for their strength, agility, and hunting skills. They are often referred to as the "king of the jungle" due to their dominant position in the animal kingdom. Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides, consisting of several females, their offspring, and a few adult males.
