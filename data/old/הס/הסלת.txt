Description: "הסלת" is a term used in Jewish religious practice. It refers to the process of removing or separating a small portion of dough from a batch of bread dough before it is baked. This portion is then set aside and burned as a symbolic offering to God. The practice of הסלת is derived from the biblical commandment to separate a portion of dough as an offering to God. It is typically performed during the holiday of Passover, but can also be done throughout the year when baking bread.
