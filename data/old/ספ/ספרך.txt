Etymology: The word "ספרד" (Sepharad) comes from the Hebrew Bible, specifically from the book of Obadiah (verse 20), where it refers to a place or region. It is believed to have originated from the Hebrew word "סְפָרַדִּים" (Sefaradim), which means "Sephardic Jews" or "Jews of Spain." The term later came to be associated with the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain.
