The connection between the gemstone and the word "book" is believed to be due to the resemblance of the gem's blue color to the color of the sky, which was associated with the divine and heavenly realms.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "ספיר" is a noun that is used to refer to the gemstone sapphire. It is a masculine noun and is typically used in the singular form. In plural form, it becomes "ספירים" (pronounced "sappirim").

Description: Sapphire is a precious gemstone that is known for its vibrant blue color. It is a variety of the mineral corundum, which is composed of aluminum oxide. The blue color of sapphires is caused by trace amounts of iron and titanium in the crystal structure. Sapphires are highly valued for their beauty and durability, and they are often used in jewelry, particularly in engagement rings and other fine pieces. In addition to blue, sapphires can also be found in a range of other colors, including pink, yellow, green, and purple.
