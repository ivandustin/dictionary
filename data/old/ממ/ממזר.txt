Etymology: The word "ממזר" (mamzer) comes from the Hebrew root מ-ז-ר (m-z-r), which means "to be polluted" or "to be mixed." It is derived from the noun זֶרַע (zera), meaning "seed" or "offspring."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "ממזר" (mamzer) is a masculine noun. It is typically used to refer to a person who is born from a forbidden sexual relationship, such as adultery or incest.

Description: In Jewish law, a mamzer is considered to have a status of impurity and is subject to certain legal restrictions. A mamzer is prohibited from marrying a person of Jewish lineage, except for another mamzer or a convert to Judaism. The status of mamzer is inherited from the mother, meaning that if a woman is a mamzeret (female mamzer), her children will also be mamzerim. It is important to note that the concept of mamzer is specific to Jewish law and does not have a direct equivalent in other legal systems.
