Etymology: The word "הַנְבִיאִים" (HaNevi'im) is a Hebrew word that translates to "the Prophets" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew root נבא (n-b-a), which means "to prophesy" or "to speak on behalf of God."

Grammar: "הַנְבִיאִים" (HaNevi'im) is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is formed by adding the definite article "הַ" (ha) at the beginning, which means "the," and the suffix "-ים" (-im) at the end, which indicates plural masculine nouns.

Description: In Jewish tradition, the term "הַנְבִיאִים" (HaNevi'im) refers to the second section of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Nevi'im. It includes the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve Minor Prophets. These books contain the writings and prophecies of various prophets who played significant roles in the history and religious development of ancient Israel. The Nevi'im is considered one of the three main sections of the Hebrew Bible, along with the Torah (the Five Books of Moses) and the Ketuvim (the Writings).
