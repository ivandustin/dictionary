Description: "הנרת" (HaNerot) is a word used in Jewish tradition to refer to the candles that are lit during the holiday of Hanukkah. Hanukkah is an eight-day Jewish festival that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. During this holiday, a special nine-branched candelabrum called a "מנורה" (Menorah) is lit, with one candle being lit each night. The candles are lit to symbolize the miracle of the oil that lasted for eight days when there was only enough oil for one day.
