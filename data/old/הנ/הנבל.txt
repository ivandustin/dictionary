Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַנְבֵל" (pronounced "ha-nevel") comes from the root נבל (n-b-l), which means "to fade away" or "to wither." It is related to the noun נְבֵלָה (nevelah), which means "carcass" or "corpse."

Grammar: "הַנְבֵל" is a masculine noun in the singular form. It is preceded by the definite article "הַ" (ha), which means "the" in English.

Description: "הַנְבֵל" refers to a carcass or a dead body of an animal. It is used to describe the remains of an animal that has died, typically due to natural causes or as a result of hunting or slaughtering. In Jewish dietary laws, the term "הַנְבֵלָה" (nevelah) is used to refer to an animal that has not been slaughtered according to the specific ritual requirements and is therefore considered unclean and unfit for consumption.
