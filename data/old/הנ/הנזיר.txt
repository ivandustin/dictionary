Etymology: The word "הנזיר" (pronounced "ha-nazir") comes from the Hebrew root נ-ז-ר (n-z-r), which means "to consecrate" or "to separate." In biblical times, a nazirite was someone who took a vow of consecration, abstaining from certain activities and practices.

Grammar: "הנזיר" is a masculine noun in Hebrew. It is in the singular form and is preceded by the definite article "ה" (ha), which means "the" in English.

Description: "הנזיר" refers to a nazirite, someone who takes a vow of consecration in Judaism. In ancient times, a nazirite would abstain from cutting their hair, consuming wine or grape products, and coming into contact with the dead. The vow was usually taken for a specific period of time and was seen as a way to demonstrate devotion and commitment to God. Today, the practice of becoming a nazirite is rare, but the term is still used to refer to someone who takes on a similar vow of separation or dedication.
