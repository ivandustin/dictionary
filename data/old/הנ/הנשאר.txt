Etymology: The Hebrew word "הַנְשָׂאָר" (pronounced: ha-nesa'ar) comes from the root נָשָׂא (nasa), which means "to lift up" or "to carry." It is derived from the noun נֵשֶׁר (nesher), which means "eagle." The word הַנְשָׂאָר is used to describe an eagle or a bird of prey.

Grammar: הַנְשָׂאָר is a masculine noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The definite article "הַ" (ha) is added to the beginning of the word to indicate that it is a specific eagle.

Description: הַנְשָׂאָר is a majestic bird known for its strength and ability to soar high in the sky. It is often used as a symbol of power and freedom. In Hebrew literature and poetry, the eagle is sometimes used metaphorically to represent courage, wisdom, and divine protection.
