Description: הנגעים, also known as "Tzaraat" in Hebrew, is a term used in the Hebrew Bible to describe a variety of skin diseases. It is often translated as "leprosy" in English, but it encompasses a broader range of conditions than just leprosy.

The laws regarding הנגעים are detailed in the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Bible.
