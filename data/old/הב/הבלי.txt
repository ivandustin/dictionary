Etymology: The word "הבלי" (pronounced "ha-ba-li") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ב-ל-ה (B-L-H), which means "to waste" or "to be in vain." It is derived from the Hebrew Bible, specifically from the book of Ecclesiastes, where it is used to describe the fleeting and transient nature of life.

Grammar: "הבלי" is a noun in Hebrew and is used to describe something that is futile, meaningless, or transient. It is often translated as "vanity" or "emptiness" in English.

Description: "הבלי" is a concept that goes beyond the literal meaning of the word. It represents the idea that many things in life are ultimately meaningless or fleeting. It is often used to reflect on the impermanence of human existence and the pursuit of material possessions or worldly achievements. In the book of Ecclesiastes, the author uses the word "הבלי" to convey a sense of disillusionment and the need to find meaning in something greater than worldly pursuits.
