Description: Bees are flying insects known for their role in pollination and producing honey. They are part of the Apidae family and are closely related to wasps and ants. Bees are known for their ability to collect nectar from flowers and convert it into honey. They live in colonies and have a complex social structure, with a queen bee, worker bees, and drones. Bees are important for the ecosystem as they help in the pollination of plants, which is crucial for the reproduction of many flowering plants.
