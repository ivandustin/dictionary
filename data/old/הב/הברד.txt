Description: "הברד" (Ha'barad) refers to the meteorological phenomenon of hail. Hail is a type of precipitation that consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice that fall from the sky during thunderstorms. It is formed when there are strong updrafts in a thunderstorm cloud, which carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere where they freeze into ice pellets. Hailstones can vary in size, from small pebbles to large golf balls or even larger. Hail can cause damage to crops, vehicles, and buildings when it falls with enough force.
