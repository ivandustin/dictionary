Description: A "צל" (tzal) is the dark area that is created when an object blocks the path of light. It is the absence of light in a specific area. Shadows are formed when an object is placed between a source of light and a surface. They can vary in size and shape depending on the position of the light source and the object casting the shadow. Shadows are an important element in art, photography, and cinematography, as they can add depth, contrast, and visual interest to an image.
