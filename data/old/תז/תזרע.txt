Etymology: The word "צרע" (tzara) comes from the Hebrew root צ-ר-ע (ts-r-a), which means "to be afflicted" or "to be struck with a plague." It is derived from the noun צָרַעַת (tsara'at), which refers to a skin disease mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

Grammar: In Hebrew, "צרע" (tzara) is a noun that is used to describe a specific skin disease. It is typically used in the singular form, but can also be used in the plural form "צרעים" (tzara'im) to refer to multiple instances of the disease.

Description: צרע (tzara) is a term used in the Hebrew Bible to describe a skin disease that was considered to be a punishment from God. It is often translated as "leprosy" in English, although it is not the same as the modern medical condition known as leprosy. The disease was characterized by white patches on the skin, and those who were afflicted with it were required to be isolated from the community until they were declared clean by a priest. The laws regarding tzara'at are detailed in the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Bible.
