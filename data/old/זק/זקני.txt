Etymology: The word "זקני" comes from the Hebrew root ז.ק.נ (z.q.n), which means "to be old" or "to age". It is derived from the noun זָקֵן (zaqen), which means "old" or "elder".

Grammar: "זקני" is the plural form of the adjective זָקֵן (zaqen), which means "old" or "elderly". In Hebrew, adjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. Therefore, זקני is used to describe multiple masculine or mixed-gender nouns that are old or elderly.

Description: זקני is used to refer to a group of old or elderly individuals. It can be used to describe a group of people who are advanced in age or who hold a position of authority and wisdom due to their age and experience.
