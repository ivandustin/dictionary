Etymology: The word "זקנתה" (pronounced "ziknat-ha") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ז.ק.נ (z.q.n), which means "to age" or "to grow old" in Hebrew. The suffix ה (ha) indicates possession, so זקנתה literally means "her old age" or "her advanced years."

Grammar: זקנתה is a noun in the feminine form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The feminine form is used when referring to a female subject or when the noun itself is inherently feminine. In this case, זקנתה is used to describe the advanced years or old age of a female subject.

Description: זקנתה is a word that describes the state of being old or advanced in years for a female subject. It can be used to refer to an elderly woman or to the concept of old age in general.
