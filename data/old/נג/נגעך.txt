Etymology: The word "נגע" (nega) comes from the Hebrew root נ.ג.ע, which means "to touch" or "to strike". 

Grammar: In Hebrew, נגע is a noun that can be used as a verb as well. It is a masculine singular noun, and its plural form is נגעים (nega'im). 

Description: נגע is a term used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to various skin diseases or conditions, often translated as "leprosy" in English. However, it is important to note that the biblical term encompasses a broader range of skin ailments than what is commonly understood as leprosy today. The term נגע can also be used metaphorically to describe a spiritual or moral blemish or affliction.
