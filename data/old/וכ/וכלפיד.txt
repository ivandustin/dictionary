Description: "וְכָל־פִּדְיֹן" is a term used in Jewish law to refer to the redemption of a firstborn son. According to Jewish tradition, the firstborn son is considered to be consecrated to God and must be redeemed by the father. This redemption is done by giving a certain amount of money or equivalent value to a Kohen (a descendant of the priestly tribe of Levi). The ceremony of pidyon haben (redemption of the firstborn) is an important ritual in Jewish culture and is typically performed when the child is one month old.
