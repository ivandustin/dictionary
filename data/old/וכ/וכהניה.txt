The root כֹּהֵן (kohen) is followed by the plural suffix יִם (im), which indicates that the noun is in the plural form. The plural form is used to refer to multiple priests.

Description: "וְכָהֵנִים" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the priests who served in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem.
