Etymology: The word "וְכַנְרוֹת" (pronounced "v'khanrot") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כנר (k-n-r), which means "to play a stringed instrument." The word is derived from the noun כִּנּוֹר (kinor), which specifically refers to a harp or lyre.

Grammar: "וְכַנְרוֹת" is a plural noun in Hebrew. The word begins with the conjunction "וְ" (vav), which means "and." The root כנר (k-n-r) is followed by the plural suffix וֹת (-ot), indicating that the word refers to multiple stringed instruments.

Description: "וְכַנְרוֹת" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to refer to various stringed instruments, particularly those played by the Levites in the Temple. It is often translated as "harp" or "lyre" in English. The exact nature of these instruments is not entirely clear, as the Hebrew term is used broadly to encompass different types of stringed instruments.
