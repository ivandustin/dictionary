Etymology: The word "וְכוֹשׁ" (pronounced "v'kosh") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כּוּשׁ (kush), which means "to be black" or "to be dark." It is derived from the noun כּוּשׁ (kush), which refers to the ancient kingdom of Cush, located in what is now modern-day Sudan.

Grammar: "וְכוֹשׁ" is a conjunction in Hebrew, which means "and Cush" in English. It is composed of the letter ו (vav), which means "and," and the word כוּשׁ (kush), which means "Cush."

Description: In the context of the Hebrew Bible, the phrase "וְכוֹשׁ" is often used to refer to the land of Cush or the people of Cush. It is mentioned in various biblical passages, including the book of Genesis, where it is described as one of the descendants of Ham, the son of Noah. The term can also be found in other ancient Near Eastern texts, where it is used to refer to the region of Nubia, which was known for its black population.
