Etymology: The word "וְכָעֵשֶׁן" (pronounced "v'ka'eshen") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כָּעַשׁ (ka'ash), which means "to smoke" or "to emit smoke." The word is derived from the noun עָשָׁן (ashan), which means "smoke."

Grammar: "וְכָעֵשֶׁן" is a phrase composed of two Hebrew words: וְ (v') which means "and," and כָעֵשֶׁן (ka'eshen) which means "like smoke." The phrase is used to make a comparison or simile, indicating that something is similar to or resembles smoke.

Description: The phrase "וְכָעֵשֶׁן" is often used in Hebrew literature and poetry to describe something that is fleeting, transient, or ephemeral. It conveys the idea that just like smoke, which quickly dissipates and disappears, the thing being described is temporary or insubstantial.
