Etymology: The word "וְכֵהֵן" (pronounced "vekohen" in Hebrew) comes from the Hebrew root כֹּהֵן (kohen), which means "priest" or "minister." It is derived from the verb כָּהַן (kahan), which means "to serve" or "to minister."

Grammar: "וְכֵהֵן" is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: וְ (ve), which means "and," and כֵהֵן (kohen), which means "priest" or "minister." In Hebrew, the word order is usually subject-verb-object, so "וְכֵהֵן" can be translated as "and the priest" or "and a priest."

Description: "וְכֵהֵן" is used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) to refer to a priest or minister who serves in the religious rituals and ceremonies of ancient Israel. The priests were descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, and they had specific duties and responsibilities in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. They were responsible for offering sacrifices, conducting rituals, and teaching the people about the laws and commandments of God. The role of the priest was highly respected and held a significant position in ancient Israelite society.
