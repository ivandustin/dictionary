Etymology: The word "וְכַצְפָּעַנְיָה" (pronounced "vekatzpa'anya") is a Hebrew word that is derived from the root צפעני (katzpa'ani), which means "to hop" or "to jump." The prefix וְ (ve) means "and," and the suffix הַ (ha) indicates the definite article "the." Therefore, the word can be translated as "and the hopping" or "and the jumping."
