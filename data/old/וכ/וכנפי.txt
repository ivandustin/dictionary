Etymology: The word "וְכָנַף" (pronounced "v'kanaf" in Hebrew) is derived from the root כָּנַף (kanaf), which means "wing" or "edge." In this context, it is used metaphorically to describe the edge or corner of a garment.

Grammar: "וְכָנַף" is a Hebrew phrase composed of two words: "וְ" (pronounced "v'") which means "and," and "כָנַף" (pronounced "kanaf") which means "wing" or "edge." It is used in the Bible to describe the fringes or tassels that were to be attached to the corners of a garment as a reminder of God's commandments.

Description: "וְכָנַף" is a term used in the Hebrew Bible (specifically in Numbers 15:38) to refer to the fringes or tassels that were to be attached to the corners of a garment. These fringes, known as tzitzit, served as a visual reminder for the Israelites to observe God's commandments. The commandment to wear tzitzit is still observed by some Jewish communities today, particularly in the form of a tallit (prayer shawl) worn during prayer.
