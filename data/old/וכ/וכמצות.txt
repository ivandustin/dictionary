Etymology: The word "וְכַמְצוֹת" is a Hebrew word that comes from the root כָּמַץ (kamats), which means "to ferment" or "to leaven." It is derived from the noun מַצָּה (matzah), which means "unleavened bread."

Grammar: "וְכַמְצוֹת" is a phrase in Hebrew that consists of two words: וְ (ve), which means "and," and כַמְצוֹת (kamtzot), which is the plural form of the noun כָּמֵץ (kametz), meaning "leavened bread." The phrase is used in the context of the Passover holiday to refer to the prohibition of eating leavened bread during the holiday.

Description: "וְכַמְצוֹת" is a term used in Jewish tradition to describe the prohibition of eating leavened bread during the Passover holiday. It is one of the central commandments of Passover, symbolizing the haste in which the Israelites left Egypt, as they did not have time to let their bread rise. Instead, they ate unleavened bread, known as matzah. The word "וְכַמְצוֹת" is often used in the context of the Passover Seder, where it is mentioned in the Haggadah (the text read during the Seder meal) to remind participants of the importance of eating only unleavened bread during the holiday.
