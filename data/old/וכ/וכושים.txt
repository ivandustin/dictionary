Grammar: "וְכוֹשִׁים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. The prefix "וְ" (v') means "and," and the word "כוֹשִׁים" (koshim) means "Cushites" or "people from Cush." In Hebrew grammar, nouns have gender and number, and this word is masculine and plural.

Description: The word "וְכוֹשִׁים" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to the people of Cush, who were descendants of Cush, the son of Ham. They are often described as having dark skin, and their land is associated with the region of Ethiopia. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to people of African descent.
