Etymology: The word "וְכַצְמֶר" (pronounced "v'katzmer") is a Hebrew word that is composed of two parts: "וְ" (pronounced "v'") meaning "and" and "כַצְמֶר" (pronounced "katzmer") meaning "like wool". 

Grammar: "וְכַצְמֶר" is a phrase composed of a conjunction "וְ" (meaning "and") and a noun "כַצְמֶר" (meaning "like wool"). In Hebrew grammar, the conjunction "וְ" is used to connect words or phrases, and the noun "כַצְמֶר" functions as a predicate noun, describing the subject of the sentence.

Description: The phrase "וְכַצְמֶר" is used in the Hebrew Bible (specifically in the book of Daniel) to describe the appearance of God's hair or the hair of an angel. It is used metaphorically to convey the idea of white or pure hair, similar to the texture and color of wool.
