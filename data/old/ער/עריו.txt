Description: The lion is a large and powerful carnivorous mammal that belongs to the Felidae family. It is known for its majestic appearance, with a muscular body, a large head, and a mane around its neck in the case of male lions. Lions are native to Africa and are often referred to as the "king of the jungle." They are known for their strength, courage, and social behavior, as they live in prides consisting of multiple females, their offspring, and a few adult males. Lions are apex predators and primarily feed on large ungulates such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are also highly territorial animals and mark their territories with scent markings and roaring.
