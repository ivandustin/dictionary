Etymology: The word "חמץ" comes from the Hebrew root ח-מ-ץ, which means "to ferment" or "to sour." It is related to the Arabic word "خمر" (khamr), which means "wine" or "fermented."

Grammar: In Hebrew, "חמץ" is a noun that is used to describe leavened or fermented food. It is also used as a verb to describe the process of fermentation or souring.

Description: "חמץ" refers to food that has undergone fermentation, particularly in the context of Passover. During the holiday, Jews are prohibited from eating or possessing any leavened products, including bread, cakes, and other foods that contain yeast or other leavening agents. The removal of "חמץ" from the home and the consumption of unleavened bread (matzah) is a central part of the Passover observance.
