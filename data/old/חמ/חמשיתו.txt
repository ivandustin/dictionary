Etymology: The word "חמשיתו" (pronounced "chamshito") is a Hebrew word derived from the root ח-מ-ש (ch-m-sh), which means "five" in Hebrew. The suffix יתו (-ito) is added to indicate possession or belonging. Therefore, חמשיתו literally means "his fifth" or "belonging to the fifth."

Grammar: חמשיתו is a noun in the masculine form. It is in the singular form, indicating that it refers to a single object or entity. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), and they can also be declined for case (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.). 

Description: חמשיתו is a specific term used in Jewish law to refer to the fifth part of a person's property or income that is given as a tithe. In Judaism, tithing is a religious obligation where individuals are required to give a portion of their income or produce to support the community and those in need. The חמשיתו is the portion that is specifically designated as the fifth part of the total amount.
