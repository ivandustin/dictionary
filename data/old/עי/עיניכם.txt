Etymology: The word "עיניקם" (pronounced "eeneekem") is a Hebrew word that comes from the root ע.נ.ק (Ayin-Nun-Kuf), which means "to nurse" or "to suckle." It is derived from the noun עֵין (ayin), meaning "eye," and the suffix ים (im), which indicates plural possessive form. Therefore, עיניקם literally means "their eyes" or "their nurslings."

Grammar: עיניקם is a noun in the plural form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word עיניקם is masculine and plural, indicating that it refers to multiple male nurslings or infants.

Description: עיניקם is a term used in Hebrew to refer to male infants or young children who are still nursing or being breastfed. It is often used in a figurative sense to describe someone who is dependent or reliant on others, similar to a young child who relies on their mother's milk for sustenance.
