Etymology: The word "עיניך" (pronounced "einecha" in Hebrew) is derived from the Hebrew root ע.נ.ה (ayin.nun.hei), which means "to see" or "to perceive." It is a possessive form of the word "עין" (ayin), which means "eye." Therefore, "עיניך" translates to "your eyes" in English.

Grammar: "עיניך" is a second-person, plural possessive form of the noun "עין" (eye). In Hebrew, possessive forms are created by adding the suffix "-יך" (-eich) to the noun. The suffix "-יך" indicates possession by the second-person, plural pronoun "you."

Description: "עיניך" is a term used to refer to someone's eyes in Hebrew. It is commonly used in everyday conversations and literature to describe the eyes of a person or to address someone directly about their eyes.
