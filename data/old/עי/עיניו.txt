Etymology: The word "עיניו" (pronounced "eino") is a Hebrew word that means "his eyes." It is derived from the Hebrew root ע.נ.ה (ayin-nun-hei), which means "to see" or "to perceive."

Grammar: "עיניו" is a possessive form of the noun "עין" (ayin), which means "eye." The suffix "-יו" (yav) indicates possession, specifically "his" or "its." Therefore, "עיניו" translates to "his eyes" or "its eyes."

Description: "עיניו" is used to refer to the eyes of a male or a gender-neutral entity. It is commonly used in Hebrew to describe the physical or metaphorical eyes of a person or an object.
