Etymology: The word "כְּשַׁדִּים" (pronounced "k'shadim") comes from the Hebrew root כְּשֶׁד (k'shad), which means "to conquer" or "to subdue." It is derived from the ancient civilization of the Chaldeans, who were known for their military prowess and conquests.

Grammar: "כְּשַׁדִּים" is a plural noun in Hebrew. It is used to refer to the Chaldeans, an ancient Semitic people who lived in the region of Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) during the first millennium BCE.

Description: The Chaldeans were a significant political and cultural force in ancient Mesopotamia. They established the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which reached its peak under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar II. The Chaldeans were known for their advancements in astronomy, mathematics, and astrology. They also played a significant role in the biblical narrative, particularly in the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people.
