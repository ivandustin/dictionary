Etymology: The word "כְּשֵׁלֶת" (keshelat) comes from the Hebrew root כ־ש־ל, which means "to stumble" or "to trip." It is derived from the noun כֶּשֶׁל (keshel), which means "stumbling" or "falling."

Grammar: "כְּשֵׁלֶת" is a feminine noun in the singular form. In Hebrew, nouns have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word is used to refer to a specific type of fish, commonly known as "sturgeon" in English.

Description: The sturgeon (כְּשֵׁלֶת) is a large, primitive fish that is found in both saltwater and freshwater environments. It has a long, slender body and is known for its bony plates, or scutes, that cover its skin. Sturgeons are highly valued for their caviar, which is made from their eggs. They are also known for their longevity, with some species living for over 100 years.
