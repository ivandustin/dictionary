Etymology: The word "כשמעך" (k'shme'cha) is a Hebrew word that comes from the root שמע (sh-m-a), which means "to hear" or "to listen." The prefix כ (k) is added to indicate "when" or "as." Therefore, כשמעך can be translated as "when you hear" or "as you hear."

Grammar: כשמעך is a compound word made up of the prefix כ (k), the root שמע (sh-m-a), and the suffix ך (cha), which indicates the second person singular possessive form. It is used to address someone directly, meaning "your hearing" or "when you hear."

Description: כשמעך is often used in Hebrew to introduce a condition or a hypothetical situation. It is similar to the English phrase "when you hear" or "if you hear." It is commonly used in conversations or instructions to indicate that something should be done or considered in response to a certain situation or information.
