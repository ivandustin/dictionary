Etymology: The word "כְּשַׁפִּיךְ" (keshafikh) is derived from the Hebrew root כְּשַׁף (keshaf), which means "to practice magic" or "to cast spells." It is related to the noun כְּשָׁפִים (keshafim), which means "sorceries" or "witchcraft."

Grammar: "כְּשַׁפִּיךְ" is a Hebrew noun in the masculine singular form. It is formed by adding the suffix ךְ (-ikh) to the root כְּשַׁף (keshaf). The suffix ךְ (-ikh) indicates possession, so the word can be translated as "your sorcerer" or "your magician."

Description: The word "כְּשַׁפִּיךְ" is used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to a person who practices magic or sorcery. It is often used in a negative context, as sorcery was considered forbidden and condemned in ancient Hebrew culture. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is deceitful or manipulative.
