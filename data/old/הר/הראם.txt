Description: Thunder is the loud sound that is produced by the rapid expansion and contraction of air surrounding a lightning bolt. It is often heard as a rumbling or booming noise and is commonly associated with storms. Thunder is caused by the intense heat generated by a lightning bolt, which causes the air to rapidly expand and create a shockwave. The sound of thunder can vary in intensity and duration depending on the distance from the lightning strike and atmospheric conditions.
