Description: In the biblical narrative, the daughters of Latzlafchad approached Moses and the leaders of the Israelites to request that they be granted an inheritance in the land of Canaan, even though their father had no sons. Their request was granted, and a new law was established to ensure that if a man dies without sons, his daughters can inherit his property. The story of Latzlafchad and his daughters is seen as an important example of women's rights and the importance of justice and fairness in the distribution of land and property.
