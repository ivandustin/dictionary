The word "ενεπρησεν" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, third person singular form. It comes from the root word "πρήσσω" (préssō), which means "to burn" or "to set on fire". The prefix "εν-" (en-) in this case indicates the completion of the action. Therefore, "ενεπρησεν" can be translated as "he/she/it set on fire" or "he/she/it burned".
