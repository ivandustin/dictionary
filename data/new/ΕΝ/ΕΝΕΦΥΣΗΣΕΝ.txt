Etymology: The word "ενεφυσησεν" comes from the Greek verb "ενεφυσα" (enephysa), which means "to blow into" or "to breathe into." It is derived from the prefix "εν-" (en-), meaning "in" or "into," and the verb "φυσαω" (physao), meaning "to blow" or "to breathe."

Grammar: "ενεφυσησεν" is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb "ενεφυσαω" (enephysao). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a past action that is viewed as a whole, without specifying its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.
