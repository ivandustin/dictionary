μυκτηρίζεται (myktirizetai) is a Greek verb that comes from the noun μύκτηρ (myktir), which means "nose." In Greek, μυκτηρίζεται is used to describe someone who is being sarcastic or mocking, often by making facial expressions or gestures with their nose. It can also be used more broadly to describe someone who is being ironic or derisive in their speech or behavior.
