Word: επλασθη

Etymology:
The word επλασθη comes from the Greek verb πλάσσω (plássō), which means "to mold" or "to shape". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates the passive voice, so επλασθη means "was molded" or "was shaped".

Grammar:
επλασθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb πλάσσω (plássō). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, επλασθη) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
επλασθη can be translated as "was molded" or "was shaped". It is often used in a figurative sense to describe the formation or creation of something, such as a work of art or a person's character. In Greek mythology, the god Prometheus is said to have molded the first humans out of clay, so the verb πλάσσω and its derivatives are often associated with the idea of creation.
