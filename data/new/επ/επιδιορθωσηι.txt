I'm sorry, but the word "επιδιορθωσηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "επιδιόρθωση" which means "correction" or "repair" in English. 

Etymology: The word "επιδιόρθωση" is derived from the prefix "επι-" meaning "on" or "upon" and the verb "διορθώνω" meaning "to correct" or "to repair". 

Grammar: "Επιδιόρθωση" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "Επιδιόρθωση" refers to the act of correcting or repairing something that is wrong or faulty. It can be used in various contexts such as in education, technology, or even in personal relationships.
