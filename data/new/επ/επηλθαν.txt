Word: επηλθαν

Etymology: επηλθαν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix επι- (epi-), which means "upon" or "on", and the verb ηλθαν (elthan), which means "they came". Therefore, επηλθαν means "they came upon" or "they arrived".

Grammar: επηλθαν is the third person plural aorist indicative active form of the verb ηρχομαι (erchomai), which means "to come". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the indicative mood indicates a statement of fact. Therefore, επηλθαν means "they came" in a completed action in the past.

Description: επηλθαν is a verb that describes the action of a group of people arriving at a certain place. It can be used in various contexts, such as describing the arrival of a group of soldiers at a battlefield, the arrival of guests at a party, or the arrival of a team at a sports event. The verb emphasizes the completed action of the arrival, rather than the ongoing process of coming.
