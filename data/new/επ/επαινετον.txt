Word: επαινετον

Etymology:
The word επαινετον (epaineton) is derived from the Greek word επαίνεσις (epainesis), which means "praise" or "commendation". The suffix -τον (-ton) is added to the end of the word to make it an adjective, meaning "praiseworthy" or "commendable".

Grammar:
επαινετον is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if επαινετον were to modify a feminine noun, it would be επαινετη (epaineti) in the singular form, and επαινετες (epainetes) in the plural form.

Description:
επαινετον is a word used to describe something that is worthy of praise or commendation. It can be used to describe a person, an action, or an object. For example, one might say "Ο αθλητής έκανε επαινετή εμφάνιση" (The athlete made a praiseworthy performance) or "Η προσπάθεια του ήταν επαινετή" (His effort was commendable).
