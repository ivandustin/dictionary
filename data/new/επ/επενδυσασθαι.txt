Word: επενδυσασθαι

Etymology:
The word επενδυσασθαι comes from the Greek verb επενδύω (ependýo), which means "to put on, to invest". The suffix -σασθαι (-sasthai) indicates that the verb is in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Grammar:
επενδυσασθαι is a verb in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. It is also in the middle voice, as mentioned above. The verb is formed from the stem επενδυσ- (ependys-), to which the middle voice suffix -ασθαι (-asthai) has been added.

Description:
επενδυσασθαι means "to invest in" or "to put money into". It is often used in the context of financial investments, but can also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of investment, such as investing time or effort into a project. The middle voice indicates that the subject is both the investor and the recipient of the investment, emphasizing the personal involvement and commitment required for successful investment.
