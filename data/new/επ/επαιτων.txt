The word "επαιτων" (epaiton) is a Greek noun that means "beggar" or "panhandler". 

Etymology: The word comes from the verb "αιτεω" (aiteo), which means "to ask" or "to request". The prefix "επι" (epi) adds emphasis to the action, so "επαιτων" literally means "one who asks insistently".

Grammar: "Επαιτων" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. In the plural form, it becomes "επαιτοι" (epaitoi).

Description: In ancient Greece, begging was a common practice among the poor and disabled. Beggars would often sit on the streets and ask for money or food from passersby. The word "επαιτων" was used to describe these individuals. Today, the word is still used in modern Greek to refer to beggars or panhandlers.
