Word: επαγωνιζεσθαι

Etymology: The word επαγωνιζεσθαι comes from the Greek verb επαγωνίζομαι (epagonizomai), which is derived from the noun αγών (agon), meaning "contest" or "struggle". The prefix επι- (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "against", giving the verb the sense of "to struggle against" or "to contend with".

Grammar: επαγωνιζεσθαι is a present passive infinitive verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εσθαι (-esthai) to the present stem επαγωνιζ- (epagoniz-). The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: επαγωνιζεσθαι means "to be contending with" or "to be struggling against" in Greek. It can refer to a physical struggle, such as in a competition or battle, or a mental struggle, such as in an argument or debate. The passive voice suggests that the subject is not necessarily choosing to engage in the struggle, but is being forced to contend with something or someone.
