Word: επιβιβασας

Etymology:
The word επιβιβασας comes from the Greek verb επιβιβαζω (epivivazo), which means "to embark" or "to board". It is derived from the prefix επι- (epi-), meaning "on" or "upon", and the verb βιβαζω (vivazo), meaning "to make go" or "to cause to move".

Grammar:
επιβιβασας is a second person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb επιβιβαζω (epivivazo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
επιβιβασας can be translated as "you embarked" or "you boarded". It is a verb that describes the action of getting on a ship, plane, or other mode of transportation. The word implies a sense of movement and progress, as the subject is leaving one place and heading towards another. The use of the aorist tense suggests that the action was completed in the past, and is not ongoing.
