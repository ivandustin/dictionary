Word: επειθοντο

Etymology: The word επειθοντο comes from the Greek verb επείθω (epeíthō), which means "to persuade" or "to convince". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *weyd- which means "to see" or "to know".

Grammar: επειθοντο is the third person plural, imperfect tense, middle voice form of the verb επείθω (epeíthō). In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, and mood. The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: επειθοντο can be translated as "they were being persuaded" or "they were convincing themselves". The middle voice form suggests that the subject was actively involved in the process of being persuaded or convincing themselves. The context in which the word is used would determine whether the subject was being persuaded by someone else or whether they were convincing themselves of something.
