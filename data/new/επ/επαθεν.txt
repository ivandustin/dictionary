Word: επαθεν

Etymology: επαθεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πάσχω (pascho), which means "to suffer" or "to experience." The prefix επ- (ep-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "on top of," so επαθεν can be translated as "suffered upon" or "experienced on top of."

Grammar: επαθεν is the aorist tense of the verb πάσχω (pascho), which means that it refers to a past action that was completed at a specific point in time. It is in the third person singular form, which means that it refers to a single subject who is not the speaker or the listener.
