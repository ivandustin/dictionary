Word: επαυσαμην

Etymology: επαυσαμην is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "παύω" (pauo), which means "to stop" or "to cease". The prefix "επ-" (epi) adds the meaning of "completely" or "thoroughly", so επαυσαμην means "I completely stopped" or "I ceased completely".

Grammar: επαυσαμην is a first-person singular aorist middle-passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, επαυσαμην means "I completely stopped myself" or "I ceased completely on my own".

Description: επαυσαμην is a strong and decisive verb that conveys the idea of a complete and intentional cessation of an action. It can be used in a variety of contexts, from stopping a physical activity to ending a conversation or a relationship. In Ancient Greek literature, it is often used to describe the moment when a character decides to change their course of action or to give up on a pursuit.
