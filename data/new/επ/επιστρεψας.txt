Word: επιστρέψας

Etymology: 
The word επιστρέψας is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "στρέφω" (strefó), which means "to turn". The prefix "επι-" (epi-) means "upon" or "on", so επιστρέφω (epistrefó) means "to turn upon" or "to turn on". The suffix "-ας" (-as) is the second person singular aorist active indicative ending, which means that the word is in the past tense and refers to the action of the second person singular subject.
