The word "επιστομιζειν" (epistomizein) is a Greek verb that means "to seal with wax." 

Etymology: The word is derived from the Greek words "επι" (epi), meaning "on" or "upon," and "στομα" (stoma), meaning "mouth." The suffix "-ιζειν" (-izein) is a common Greek verb ending that indicates the action of making or doing something.

Grammar: "Επιστομιζειν" is an infinitive verb form, which means it is not conjugated to match a specific subject or tense. In order to use it in a sentence, it would need to be conjugated appropriately.

Description: The act of "επιστομιζειν" was commonly used in ancient times to seal letters or documents with wax. The wax would be melted and dripped onto the paper or parchment, and then a seal or stamp would be pressed into the wax to create a unique mark. This mark would serve as a way to authenticate the document and ensure that it had not been tampered with. Today, the practice of "επιστομιζειν" is largely obsolete, as most documents are now signed electronically or with ink.
