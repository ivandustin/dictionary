Word: επεκαλεσαν

Etymology:
The word επεκαλεσαν (epekalesan) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call." The prefix επι- (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "to" the verb, giving it the sense of "to call upon" or "to invoke."

Grammar:
επεκαλεσαν is a third-person plural aorist active indicative verb in Greek. This means that it is a past tense verb, indicating that the action it describes has already happened. The third-person plural form indicates that the subject of the verb is a group of people, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action of the verb.

Description:
The word επεκαλεσαν is often used in a religious or spiritual context to describe the act of calling upon a deity or higher power for help or guidance. It can also be used more generally to describe the act of calling upon someone or something for assistance or support. In both cases, the word implies a sense of urgency or desperation, as if the person or group calling upon someone or something is in great need.
