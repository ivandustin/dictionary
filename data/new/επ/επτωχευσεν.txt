Word: επτωχεύσεν

Etymology: The word επτωχεύσεν comes from the Greek verb επτωχεύω (eptochévo), which means "to become bankrupt" or "to be impoverished". The verb is formed from the prefix επτο- (epto-), meaning "lacking" or "devoid of", and the root χευσ- (chévso), meaning "to pour out" or "to empty".

Grammar: επτωχεύσεν is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb επτωχεύω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an implied third person singular) is performing the action.
