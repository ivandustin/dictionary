Word: επωρωθησαν

Etymology:
The word επωρωθησαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πωρόω (pōróō), which means "to harden" or "to petrify". The prefix επι- (epi-) means "upon" or "on top of", so επωρωθησαν can be translated as "they were hardened" or "they were petrified".

Grammar:

The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb. The third-person plural form means that the subject is a group of people or things, and the -θη- (-thē-) suffix indicates that the verb is in the passive voice.
