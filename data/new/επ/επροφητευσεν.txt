Word: επροφητευσεν

Etymology: 
The word επροφητευσεν (epropheteusen) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word προφητεύω (propheteuo), which means "to prophesy" or "to foretell." The prefix ε- (e-) in this word indicates that the action of prophesying has already taken place in the past.

Grammar:
επροφητευσεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates that the action of prophesying was completed in the past, while the active voice indicates that the subject (he/she/it) performed the action. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description:
επροφητευσεν is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (26:68) and the Gospel of Mark (14:65). In both instances, it is used to describe the actions of those who were mocking Jesus during his trial before the high priest. The word is translated as "prophesied" or "predicted" in English, but in this context, it is used sarcastically to suggest that Jesus was not a true prophet.
