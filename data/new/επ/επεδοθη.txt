Word: επεδόθη (epedothi)

Etymology: The word επεδόθη comes from the Greek verb επιδίδωμι (epididomi), which means "to give over, to deliver, to entrust." The prefix επι- (epi-) means "over" or "upon," and the root δίδωμι (didomi) means "to give."

Grammar: επεδόθη is a passive verb in the aorist tense, third person singular. The aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (in this case, the thing being given over or delivered) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: επεδόθη means "was given over" or "was delivered." It is often used in legal or official contexts to describe the transfer of property, rights, or responsibilities from one party to another. It can also be used more generally to describe the act of entrusting something to someone else.
