The word επιστευετε (episteuete) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πιστεύω (pisteuo), which means "to believe" or "to have faith". The prefix επι- (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "in addition to", so επιστευετε can be translated as "you believe upon" or "you have faith in addition to".
