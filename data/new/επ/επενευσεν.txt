Word: επενευσεν

Etymology: The word επενευσεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word επινευω (epineuo), which means "to nod in assent" or "to give a sign with the head." The prefix επι (epi) means "on" or "upon," and the verb ending -εν (en) indicates the past tense.

Grammar: επενευσεν is a third-person singular aorist indicative active verb in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the indicative mood indicates a statement of fact. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description: επενευσεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible in Luke 7:39. The verse reads, "Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, 'If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.' And Jesus answering said to him, 'Simon, I have something to say to you.' And he answered, 'Say it, Teacher.' 'A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?' Simon answered, 'The one, I suppose, to whom he forgave more.' And he said to him, 'You have judged rightly.' Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.' And he said to her, 'Your sins are forgiven.' Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, 'Who is this, who even forgives sins?' And he said to the woman, 'Your faith has saved you; go in peace.'"

In this passage, επενευσεν is used to describe Jesus' response to Simon's statement. Jesus nodded in agreement with Simon's statement that the woman was a sinner, but then went on to tell a parable about forgiveness. The use of επενευσεν emphasizes Jesus' authority and wisdom in the situation.
