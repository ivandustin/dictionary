Word: επεσκιασεν

Etymology:
The word επεσκιασεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word σκιά (skia), which means "shadow". The prefix επε- (epe-) means "upon" or "over", so the word επεσκιασεν (epeskiasen) can be translated as "overshadowed" or "cast a shadow over".

Grammar:
επεσκιασεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. It is conjugated from the verb σκιάζω (skiázo), which means "to cast a shadow". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an implied third-person singular) performed the action.

Description:
επεσκιασεν can be translated as "overshadowed" or "cast a shadow over". It is often used metaphorically to describe a situation where something is obscured or hidden by something else. For example, one might say that a person's achievements were overshadowed by their controversial personal life. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo was said to have overshadowed the city of Delphi with his power and wisdom.
