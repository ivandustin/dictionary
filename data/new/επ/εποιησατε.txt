Word: εποιησατε

Etymology: εποιησατε is a Greek word that comes from the verb ποιέω (poiéo), which means "to make" or "to do". The prefix επι- (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "over", so εποιησατε can be translated as "you made upon" or "you did over".

Grammar: εποιησατε is the second person plural aorist indicative active form of the verb ποιέω (poiéo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates that the action is a statement of fact, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description: εποιησατε is a verb form that is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John (15:16). In this passage, Jesus is speaking to his disciples and telling them that they did not choose him, but rather he chose them to go and bear fruit. The verb form εποιησατε is used to emphasize the idea that the disciples did not make the choice themselves, but rather it was made upon them by Jesus.
