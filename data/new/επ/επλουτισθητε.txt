Word: επλουτισθητε

Etymology: The word επλουτισθητε is derived from the Greek verb πλουτίζω (ploutízo), which means "to enrich" or "to make rich". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates the second person plural form of the verb, making επλουτισθητε the past tense form of "you all were enriched".

Grammar: επλουτισθητε is a second person plural past tense verb in the passive voice. It is formed by adding the prefix ε- (e-) to the stem πλουτίζω (ploutízo) and conjugating it in the aorist tense. The passive voice indicates that the subject (you all) received the action of the verb (were enriched) rather than performing it.

Description: επλουτισθητε is a Greek verb that describes a state of being enriched or made rich. It is used in the New Testament of the Bible in 1 Corinthians 1:5, where Paul writes to the church in Corinth, "that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge". The verb emphasizes the idea of abundance and prosperity, and suggests that the enrichment was not something the Corinthians achieved on their own, but rather something that was given to them.
