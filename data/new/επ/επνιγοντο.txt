Word: επνιγοντο

Etymology: The word επνιγοντο comes from the Greek verb πνίγω (pnigo), which means "to choke" or "to suffocate". The prefix επ- (ep-) in this case indicates a completed action, so επνιγοντο means "they were choked" or "they suffocated".

Grammar: επνιγοντο is the third person plural, past tense, passive voice form of the verb πνίγω (pnigo). In this form, the subject is not doing the action of choking, but rather is being choked or suffocated by an external force.

Description: επνιγοντο is a word that describes a past event where a group of people were choked or suffocated. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as describing a tragic accident or a natural disaster. The word has a sense of finality to it, as the action of choking or suffocating has been completed and cannot be undone.
