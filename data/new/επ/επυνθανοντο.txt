Word: επυνθανοντο

Etymology:
The word επυνθανοντο comes from the Greek verb πυνθάνομαι (pyntánomai), which means "to inquire" or "to ask". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the past tense and that it is plural.

Grammar:
επυνθανοντο is a third-person plural form of the aorist tense in Greek. It is a passive voice verb, which means that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action rather than performing it. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it is implied that it is a group of people who were being asked or inquired of.
