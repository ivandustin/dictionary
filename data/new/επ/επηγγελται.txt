The word "επηγγελται" (epangelte) is a Greek verb in the present tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. It is derived from the root word "αγγελία" (angelia), which means "message" or "announcement." The prefix "επι-" (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "over," so "επηγγελται" can be translated as "has been promised" or "has been announced."

In terms of grammar, "επηγγελται" is a third-person singular verb, meaning it refers to a single subject who is not the speaker or the listener. The passive voice indicates that the subject is receiving the action of the verb rather than performing it. The indicative mood suggests that the speaker is making a statement of fact or reality.

Overall, "επηγγελται" is a word that conveys the idea of a promise or announcement that has been made and is currently in effect.
