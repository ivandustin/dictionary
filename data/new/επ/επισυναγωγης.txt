Word: επισυναγωγης

Etymology: The word επισυναγωγης comes from the Greek roots επι- (epi-), meaning "on" or "upon," and συναγωγή (synagoge), meaning "assembly" or "gathering." Therefore, επισυναγωγης can be translated as "upon gathering" or "on assembly."

Grammar: επισυναγωγης is a feminine noun in the genitive case. In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and it often corresponds to the English preposition "of." For example, the phrase "the book of the teacher" would be translated as "το βιβλίο του δασκάλου" (to vivlio tou daskalou) in Greek.

Description: επισυναγωγης can refer to a gathering or assembly of people, especially in a religious context. In the New Testament, the word is often used to describe the gathering of Jewish worshippers in a synagogue. It can also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of gathering or assembly.
