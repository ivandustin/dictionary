Word: επηγγειλατο

Etymology:
The word επηγγειλατο (epēngeilato) is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix επι- (epi-) meaning "upon" or "over" and the verb αγγελλω (angellō) meaning "to announce" or "to proclaim". Therefore, επηγγειλατο can be translated as "he/she/it promised" or "he/she/it announced upon".

Grammar:
επηγγειλατο is a third-person singular aorist middle-passive indicative verb in Greek. It is conjugated from the verb αγγελλω (angellō) in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. The middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. 

Description:
επηγγειλατο is a verb that expresses a promise or an announcement made by someone in the past. It is often used in the context of a covenant or a pledge, where one party promises to do something for another. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe God's promises to his people, such as in Luke 24:49 where Jesus promises to send the Holy Spirit to his disciples. The word can also be used in a more general sense to describe any kind of promise or announcement made by someone.
