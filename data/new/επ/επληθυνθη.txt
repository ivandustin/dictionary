Word: επληθυνθη

Etymology: The word επληθυνθη is derived from the Greek verb πληθύνω (plithyno), which means "to multiply" or "to increase in number". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a completed action, so επληθυνθη means "was multiplied" or "was increased in number".

Grammar: επληθυνθη is a past tense verb in the passive voice. It is conjugated from the verb πληθύνω (plithyno) in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (which is not specified in this case) received the action of the verb.
