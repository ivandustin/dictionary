Word: επεκειντο

Etymology:
The word επεκειντο comes from the Greek language. It is a compound word, consisting of the prefix επι- (epi-), meaning "upon" or "over", and the verb κεινο (keino), meaning "to lie down" or "to recline". The word επεκειντο, therefore, means "they lay upon" or "they reclined upon".

Grammar:
επεκειντο is a verb in the past tense, third person plural form. It is a passive verb, indicating that the action was done to the subject rather than by the subject. In this case, the subject is not specified, so it could refer to any group of people who were reclining or lying down.
