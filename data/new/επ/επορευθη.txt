Word: επορευθη

Etymology:
The word επορευθη (eporeuthē) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πορεύομαι (poreuomai), which means "to go, to travel." The prefix επι- (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "to" the verb, giving it the sense of "to go upon" or "to go to."

Grammar:
επορευθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb πορεύομαι (poreuomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action. Therefore, επορευθη can be translated as "he/she/it was gone to" or "he/she/it had gone to."

Description:
επορευθη is a word that describes a completed action of going or traveling to a specific place. It can be used to indicate that someone has arrived at a destination or that they have completed a journey. The word has a sense of finality to it, as it implies that the action of going has been completed and the subject has reached their intended destination.
