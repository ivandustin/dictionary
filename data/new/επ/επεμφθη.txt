Word: επεμφθη

Etymology:
The word επεμφθη comes from the Greek verb επιστέλλω (epistellō), which means "to send a message" or "to dispatch." The word is derived from the prefix επι- (epi-), which means "upon" or "over," and the verb στέλλω (stellō), which means "to send."

Grammar:
επεμφθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb επιστέλλω (epistellō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
επεμφθη can be translated as "he/she/it was sent" or "he/she/it was dispatched." The word implies that the subject was sent or dispatched by someone else, rather than acting on their own. The context of the sentence would determine who or what was being sent.
