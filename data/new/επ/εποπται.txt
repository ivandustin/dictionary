Word: εποπται

Etymology:
The word εποπται (epoptai) is derived from the Greek word εποπτεύω (epopteuo), which means "to observe" or "to watch over". In ancient Greece, the epoptai were a group of initiates who were granted access to the innermost secrets of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a religious cult dedicated to the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone.

Grammar:
εποπται is a plural noun in Greek. It is in the nominative case, which is used for the subject of a sentence. The word does not have any gender, as Greek nouns are either masculine, feminine, or neuter. In this case, the lack of gender indicates that the word refers to a group of people rather than a specific gender.
