Description:
επιον is a rare word in Greek literature, and its meaning is not entirely clear. It appears only once in Homer's Iliad (Book 11, line 85), where it is used to describe the chariot of the Trojan warrior Asius. Some scholars believe that επιον refers to a type of chariot, while others suggest that it may be a poetic epithet for a chariot. The exact meaning of the word remains a subject of debate among scholars.
