Word: επιστευσαμεν

Etymology: 
The word επιστευσαμεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πιστεύω (pisteuo), which means "to believe" or "to have faith". The prefix επι- (epi-) means "upon" or "on", so επιστευσαμεν can be translated as "we believed upon" or "we had faith in".

Grammar:
επιστευσαμεν is the first person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb πιστεύω (pisteuo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The active voice indicates that the subject (we) performed the action of believing, rather than receiving the action.

Description:
επιστευσαμεν means "we believed" in English. It is a verb that expresses an act of faith or trust in something or someone. The context in which it is used can vary, but it often refers to a religious or spiritual belief. The word emphasizes the action of believing, rather than the content of the belief itself.
