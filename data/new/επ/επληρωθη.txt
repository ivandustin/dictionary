Word: επληρωθη

Etymology: επληρωθη is a Greek word that comes from the verb πληρόω (plēróō), which means "to fill" or "to complete". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a completed action, so επληρωθη means "it was completed" or "it was fulfilled".

Grammar: επληρωθη is a passive verb in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. It is in the third person singular form, which means that it refers to a singular subject that is not the speaker or the listener. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, aspect, mood, voice, and person of the subject.

Description: επληρωθη is a word that is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the fulfillment of prophecies or promises. For example, in Matthew 5:17, Jesus says, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." In this context, επληρωθη means that Jesus has completed or fulfilled the requirements of the Law and the Prophets. The word can also be used more generally to describe the completion of any task or goal.
