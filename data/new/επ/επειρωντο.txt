Word: επειρωντο

Etymology:
The word επειρωντο comes from the Greek verb πειράομαι (peiráomai), which means "to try, attempt, test". The prefix επ- (ep-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "over", so επειρωντο can be translated as "they were trying upon" or "they were testing over".

Grammar:
επειρωντο is the third person plural, imperfect middle/passive indicative form of the verb πειράομαι. In this form, the verb indicates that the action is being done by or to the subject, and that the action is ongoing or repeated in the past. The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is either performing the action on themselves (middle) or receiving the action (passive).

Description:
επειρωντο is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Acts 17:18, where it describes the actions of some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers who were disputing with the apostle Paul in Athens. The word conveys the idea of these philosophers attempting to test or challenge Paul's ideas or beliefs.
