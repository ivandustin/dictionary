The word "επιστασθε" (epistasthe) is a verb in the Greek language, which means "to know" or "to understand". It is derived from the root word "επιστημη" (episteme), which means "knowledge" or "science". 

In terms of grammar, "επιστασθε" is the second person plural present middle/passive imperative form of the verb "επισταμαι" (epistamai), which is the middle/passive voice of "ειδον" (eidon), the aorist tense of "οραω" (orao), meaning "to see". 

In usage, "επιστασθε" is often used in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the letters of Paul, to exhort or encourage readers to have knowledge or understanding of certain concepts or teachings.
