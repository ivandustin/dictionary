The word "επισχυον" (episkhyon) is a Greek verb in the present tense, active voice, and indicative mood. It comes from the root word "σχεω" (skheo), which means "to hold" or "to have." The prefix "επι" (epi) adds the meaning of "upon" or "over," so "επισχυον" can be translated as "I am holding upon" or "I am having over."

In terms of grammar, "επισχυον" is a first-person singular verb, meaning it is used to describe an action that the speaker is doing. The present tense indicates that the action is happening currently, and the active voice means that the subject (in this case, "I") is performing the action.

Overall, "επισχυον" is a relatively uncommon word in modern Greek, but it can be found in ancient Greek texts. Its meaning is somewhat ambiguous and can depend on the context in which it is used.
