Word: επιγνωσομαι

Etymology:
The word επιγνωσομαι comes from the Greek root words επί (epi) meaning "upon" or "over" and γνώση (gnósi) meaning "knowledge" or "understanding". The prefix επί (epi) is often used in Greek to indicate a sense of intensification or emphasis, so επιγνωσομαι can be understood as "to fully know" or "to have a complete understanding of".

Grammar:
επιγνωσομαι is a first-person singular future middle deponent verb in Greek. The middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on themselves, and the deponent form means that the verb has a passive meaning but is conjugated in the active voice. The future tense indicates that the action will take place at some point in the future.

Description:
επιγνωσομαι can be translated to English as "I will recognize" or "I will acknowledge". It is often used in a spiritual or religious context to refer to a deep understanding or recognition of one's own faults or shortcomings. In this sense, it can be seen as a form of self-reflection or introspection. The word can also be used more generally to refer to any kind of recognition or acknowledgement, such as recognizing a person or a situation.
