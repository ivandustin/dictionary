Etymology:
The word επεθεντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "τιθημι" (tithemi), which means "to place" or "to put". The prefix "επι" (epi) means "upon" or "on top of". Therefore, επεθεντο can be translated as "they placed upon" or "they put on top of".

Grammar:
επεθεντο is a third-person plural aorist middle indicative verb in ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on themselves.
