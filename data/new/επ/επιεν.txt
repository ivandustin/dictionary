Word: επιεν

Etymology:
The word επιεν (epien) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word επί (epi), which means "on" or "upon." The suffix -εν (-en) is a past tense marker, indicating that the action of the verb has already taken place. Therefore, επιεν can be translated as "he/she/it came upon" or "he/she/it arrived at."

Grammar:
επιεν is a third-person singular aorist indicative active verb in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement or asking a question about a fact. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.

Description:
επιεν is a relatively rare verb in Ancient Greek, appearing only a few times in the New Testament. One notable instance is in Luke 10:32, where it is used to describe the arrival of the Good Samaritan at the wounded man on the side of the road. The verb emphasizes the suddenness and unexpectedness of the Samaritan's arrival, as if he came upon the scene by chance. Overall, επιεν conveys a sense of movement towards a destination, with the implication that the arrival was not planned or anticipated.
