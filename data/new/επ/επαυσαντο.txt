Word: επαυσαντο

Etymology:
The word επαυσαντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "αυσαντο" which means "to stop" or "to cease". The prefix "επ-" is added to the root word to indicate a completed action, making the word επαυσαντο mean "they stopped" or "they ceased".

Grammar:
επαυσαντο is a third-person plural aorist middle-passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, the subject is plural, meaning "they", and the verb form indicates that "they" stopped or ceased something.
