Word: επεταξεν

Etymology: επεταξεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "τασσω" (tasso), which means "to arrange" or "to put in order." The prefix "επι" (epi) adds the meaning of "upon" or "over," so επεταξεν can be translated as "he/she ordered" or "he/she commanded."

Grammar: επεταξεν is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb τασσω (tasso). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description: επεταξεν is a verb that is often used in the context of military or authoritative commands. It implies a sense of urgency and importance, as if the person giving the order expects it to be carried out immediately and without question. In the New Testament, επεταξεν is used to describe Jesus' commands to his disciples, such as when he ordered the storm to be still (Mark 4:39) or when he commanded the unclean spirit to come out of a man (Luke 8:29).
