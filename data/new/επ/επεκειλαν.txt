The word "επεκειλαν" (epekeilan) is a verb in the Greek language. 

Etymology: The word is derived from the Greek verb "κείλω" (keilo), which means "to lean" or "to incline". The prefix "επε-" (epe-) is an intensifier, so "επεκειλαν" can be translated as "they leaned heavily" or "they inclined strongly".

Grammar: "Επεκειλαν" is the third person plural aorist indicative active form of the verb "κείλω". In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates a statement of fact, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description: The word "επεκειλαν" is used to describe a strong inclination or leaning, either literally or figuratively. It can be used to describe physical objects that are leaning heavily, or to describe a person's strong inclination towards a particular idea or course of action.
