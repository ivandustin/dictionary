Word: επεγνωμεν

Etymology:
The word επεγνωμεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γινώσκω (ginósko), which means "to know." The prefix επε- (epe-) adds the meaning of "fully" or "completely," so επεγνωμεν can be translated as "we have fully known" or "we have completely understood."

Grammar:
επεγνωμεν is a first-person plural perfect indicative active verb in Ancient Greek. The perfect tense indicates a completed action in the past with ongoing results in the present. The indicative mood indicates a statement of fact. The active voice indicates that the subject (we) performed the action of knowing.

Description:
επεγνωμεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible in 1 John 4:16, where it says "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us." The verb emphasizes the idea that the knowledge of God's love is not just a surface-level understanding, but a deep and complete knowledge that has ongoing effects in the present.
