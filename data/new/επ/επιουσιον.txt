The word "επιουσιον" (epiousion) is a Greek term that appears in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, specifically in the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:11 and Luke 11:3). It is commonly translated as "daily" or "daily bread," but its exact meaning is somewhat unclear and has been the subject of much debate among scholars.

Etymologically, the word is derived from the Greek words "epi" (meaning "on" or "over") and "ousia" (meaning "substance" or "essence"). Some scholars have suggested that the word may have originally meant something like "essential" or "necessary," rather than specifically referring to bread or food.

In terms of grammar, the word is an adjective in the neuter gender, singular number, and accusative case. This grammatical form is somewhat unusual, and has led some scholars to suggest that the word may have been coined specifically for use in the Lord's Prayer.

Overall, the exact meaning of "επιουσιον" remains somewhat uncertain, and different translations and interpretations have been proposed over the years. However, it is generally understood to refer to the idea of daily sustenance or provision, whether that be physical food or spiritual nourishment.
