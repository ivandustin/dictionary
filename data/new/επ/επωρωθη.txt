Word: επωρωθη

Etymology: The word επωρωθη comes from the Greek verb πωρόω (pōróō), which means "to harden" or "to petrify". The prefix επι- (epi-) means "upon" or "on top of", so επωρωθη can be translated as "it was hardened upon".

Grammar: επωρωθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb πωρόω (pōróō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. Therefore, επωρωθη can be translated as "it was hardened upon" or "it became petrified".

Description: επωρωθη is a word that describes the process of hardening or petrifying. It can be used in a literal sense to describe the hardening of a material, such as stone or wood, or in a figurative sense to describe the hardening of a person's heart or attitude. The word has a strong connotation of permanence and immovability, suggesting that once something has been hardened, it cannot be easily changed or undone.
