Word: επικρανθη

Etymology: The word επικρανθη comes from the Greek verb επικραίνω (epikraino), which means "to prevail" or "to overcome". The suffix -θη (-the) is a passive ending, indicating that the action of prevailing or overcoming was done to the subject of the verb.

Grammar: επικρανθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb επικραίνω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an implied "it" or "they") received the action of the verb rather than performing it.

Description: επικρανθη can be translated as "it was prevailed upon" or "it was overcome". The word implies that some force or influence was exerted on the subject, causing it to yield or submit. The context in which the word is used would determine the specific meaning and implications of the action described.
