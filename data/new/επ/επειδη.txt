Word: επειδή

Etymology:
The word επειδή (epidí) is a conjunction in the Greek language, which means "because" or "since". It is derived from the combination of two words: επί (epí) meaning "on" or "upon" and είδος (eídos) meaning "form" or "appearance". Therefore, επειδή can be translated as "on account of the form" or "because of the appearance".

Grammar:

It is often used to connect two clauses in a sentence, where the first clause expresses the cause or reason and the second clause expresses the effect or result. For example: "Δεν πήγα στο σχολείο επειδή ήμουν άρρωστος" (I didn't go to school because I was sick).

Description:

It is important to note that επειδή is not interchangeable with other conjunctions such as αλλά (but) or και (and), as it has a specific meaning and function in a sentence.
