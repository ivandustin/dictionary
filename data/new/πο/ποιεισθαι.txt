Word: ποιεισθαι

Etymology:
The word ποιεισθαι comes from the Greek verb ποιέω (poiéō), which means "to make" or "to do". The suffix -σθαι (-sthai) is a reflexive suffix, indicating that the action is being done to oneself. Therefore, ποιεισθαι means "to make oneself" or "to do for oneself".

Grammar:
ποιεισθαι is a present middle/passive infinitive form of the verb ποιέω. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, mood, and person. The present tense indicates that the action is happening now, the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, and the infinitive form indicates that the verb is not conjugated to match a specific subject.

Description:
ποιεισθαι is a versatile verb that can be used in a variety of contexts. It can mean "to make oneself" or "to do for oneself", as in the phrase "ποιεισθαι φίλον" (to make oneself a friend). It can also mean "to cause" or "to bring about", as in the phrase "τί ποιεῖς;" (what are you doing?). Additionally, it can be used in a reflexive sense to indicate that the subject is performing an action on themselves, as in the phrase "ἑαυτὸν ποιεῖσθαι καλόν" (to make oneself beautiful).
