Word: ποσοι

Etymology:
The word ποσοι (posoi) is derived from the Greek word πόσος (posos), which means "how much" or "how many". It is a combination of the prefix πο- (po-), which means "how" and the suffix -σος (-sos), which means "so much".

Grammar:
ποσοι is a masculine plural form of the Greek interrogative pronoun πόσος (posos), which means "how much" or "how many". It is used to ask questions about quantity or number. In Greek, interrogative pronouns decline like adjectives, so ποσοι changes its form depending on the gender and number of the noun it modifies.

Description:
ποσοι is commonly used in Greek to ask questions about the number of people or things. For example, ποσοί είναι οι φίλοι σου; (posoi einai oi filoi sou?) means "how many friends do you have?" It can also be used to ask about the quantity of something, such as ποσοί καφέδες θέλετε; (posoi kafedes thelete?) which means "how many coffees do you want?"
