Word: πορευθωσιν

Etymology:
The word πορευθωσιν (poreuthōsin) is a verb form in the Greek language. It is derived from the root word πορεύομαι (poreuomai), which means "to go" or "to travel". The suffix -θωσιν (-thōsin) is a third-person plural present subjunctive ending, indicating that the action of the verb is uncertain or hypothetical.

Grammar:
πορευθωσιν is a third-person plural present subjunctive form of the verb πορεύομαι (poreuomai). In Greek, the subjunctive mood is used to express doubt, uncertainty, or hypothetical situations. The present tense indicates that the action is happening now, and the third-person plural form indicates that the subject is a group of people.

Description:
πορευθωσιν can be translated as "let them go" or "may they go". It is often used in the context of giving a command or expressing a wish. For example, in the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus tells his disciples to "go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19), using the imperative form of the verb πορεύομαι. In contrast, πορευθωσιν is used in a more hypothetical or uncertain way, expressing a desire or hope that a group of people will go somewhere or do something.
