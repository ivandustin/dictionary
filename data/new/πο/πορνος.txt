Word: πορνος

Etymology:
The word πορνος (pronounced "pornos") is derived from the ancient Greek word πορνη (pronounced "pornē"), which means "prostitute" or "harlot". The word is believed to have originated from the verb περνάω (pronounced "pernaō"), which means "to sell". In ancient Greece, prostitution was a common practice, and the word πορνος was used to refer to both male and female prostitutes.

Grammar:
In Greek, πορνος is a masculine noun, and its plural form is πόρνοι (pronounced "pornoi"). It is declined like other second-declension nouns, with the genitive form being πόρνου (pronounced "pornou").

Description:
The word πορνος is often translated as "prostitute" or "whore", but it can also refer to someone who engages in sexual immorality or promiscuity. In the New Testament of the Bible, the word is used to describe those who engage in sexual sin, and it is often associated with other sins such as idolatry and drunkenness. The word has taken on a negative connotation in modern times, and it is often used as a derogatory term to describe someone who engages in sexual activity for money or other forms of gain.
