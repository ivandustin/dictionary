I'm sorry, but the word "πονου" is not a valid Greek word. It is possible that you meant to type "πόνου", which is the genitive form of the Greek word "πόνος" (ponos), meaning "pain" or "hardship". 

Etymology: The word "πόνος" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *pen- meaning "to suffer" or "to toil". 

Grammar: "πόνου" is the genitive singular form of the noun "πόνος". In Greek, the genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and is often translated into English as "of" or "'s". 

Description: "πόνος" is a common Greek noun that can refer to physical or emotional pain, as well as toil or labor. It is often used in medical contexts to describe various types of pain, such as headache (κεφαλαλγία) or back pain (πόνος στη μέση). In literature and poetry, it can also be used metaphorically to describe emotional or spiritual suffering.
