Etymology:
The word πορευεσθε (poreuesthe) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πορεύομαι (poreuomai), which means "to go, to travel, to journey." It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *per- which means "to lead, to pass over."

Grammar:
πορευεσθε is a second-person plural present middle/passive imperative verb in Greek. It is used to give a command or instruction to a group of people. The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, and the imperative mood indicates that the verb is a command.

For example, in Matthew 28:19, Jesus tells his disciples, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." In Acts 9:15, Jesus tells Ananias to go and lay hands on Saul (later known as Paul) to restore his sight.
