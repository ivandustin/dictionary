Sorry, I cannot provide a definition for the word "πολει" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the Greek word "πόλη" which means "city". 

Etymology: The word "πόλη" comes from the Ancient Greek word "πόλις" (polis) which also means "city". 

Grammar: "πόλη" is a feminine noun in Greek and its plural form is "πόλεις" (poleis). 

Description: "πόλη" refers to a populated urban area with a distinct identity and government. It can also refer to the citizens of a city or the city as a whole.
