Etymology:
The word ποιμενων (poimenon) is a Greek word that comes from the root word ποιμήν (poimēn), which means "shepherd" or "herdsman". In Greek mythology, the god Apollo was often referred to as a shepherd, and the word ποιμήν was also used to describe the leaders of the people.

Grammar:
ποιμενων is the genitive singular form of the noun ποιμήν (poimēn), which means "shepherd" or "herdsman". In Greek, the genitive case is used to show possession or relationship, and is often translated into English as "of" or "'s". Therefore, ποιμενων can be translated as "of the shepherd" or "of the herdsman".

Description:
ποιμενων is a word that is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John. In John 10:11, Jesus refers to himself as "the good shepherd" (ὁ ποιμὴν ὁ καλός) who lays down his life for his sheep. In John 21:16, Jesus asks Peter if he loves him, and when Peter responds affirmatively, Jesus tells him to "feed my sheep" (βόσκε τὰ πρόβατά μου) three times. The word ποιμενων is also used in other parts of the New Testament to refer to shepherds or leaders of the church.
