Word: πονηρος

Etymology:
The word πονηρος (ponēros) comes from the Greek root word πόνος (ponos), which means "pain" or "toil." The suffix -ρος (-ros) is a common Greek suffix that denotes a quality or characteristic. Therefore, πονηρος can be translated as "full of pain" or "painful."

Grammar:
In Greek, πονηρος is an adjective that can be used to describe a person, thing, or situation. It is declined like other first- and second-declension adjectives, and its gender and number must agree with the noun it modifies. For example, if πονηρος is used to describe a masculine singular noun, it would be declined as πονηρός (ponēros), while if it is used to describe a feminine singular noun, it would be declined as πονηρά (ponēra).

Description:
The word πονηρος is often translated as "wicked," "evil," or "malicious." It can be used to describe a person who is morally corrupt or deceitful, or a situation that is harmful or unpleasant. In some contexts, it can also be used to describe something that is difficult or troublesome. Overall, πονηρος carries a negative connotation and is not typically used to describe something positive.
