Word: ποιησασθαι

Description: ποιησασθαι means "to make oneself" or "to create oneself" in Greek. It implies a deliberate and intentional act of self-creation or self-fashioning. In ancient Greek philosophy, the concept of ποιησις (poiesis) was often used to describe the process of creating or bringing something into being, whether it be a work of art, a piece of writing, or even one's own self. The verb ποιησασθαι captures this idea of intentional self-creation, suggesting that one has the power to shape and mold oneself into the person they want to be.
