I'm sorry, but the word "πορευσηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling or a non-standard variation of the word "πορεία" (poreía), which means "journey" or "procession". 

Etymology: The word "πορεία" comes from the ancient Greek verb "πορεύομαι" (poreúomai), which means "to go, to travel". 

Grammar: "Πορεία" is a feminine noun in Greek and belongs to the second declension. Its plural form is "πορείες" (poreíes). 

Description: "Πορεία" can refer to a physical journey or procession, as well as a metaphorical journey or process. It can also refer to a military march or a parade. In modern Greek, it is often used to describe traffic flow or the progress of a project or plan.
