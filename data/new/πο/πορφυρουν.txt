Sorry, I cannot define the word "πορφυρουν" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "πορφυρούν", which is the present participle form of the verb "πορφυρόω" (porphyroo) meaning "to dye purple". 

Etymology: The word "πορφυρόω" comes from the noun "πορφύρα" (porphyra) meaning "purple dye" or "purple color". 

Grammar: "πορφυρούν" is the present participle form of the verb "πορφυρόω" and it is declined as follows: masculine/feminine/neuter, singular/plural, nominative/accusative/vocative/genitive/dative. 

Description: "πορφυρούν" describes something or someone that is currently being dyed purple or is in the process of turning purple. It can also be used as an adjective to describe something that is purple in color.
