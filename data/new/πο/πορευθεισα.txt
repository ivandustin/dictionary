The word "πορευθεισα" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, passive voice, and feminine gender. It comes from the root verb "πορεύομαι" which means "to go, to travel, to journey". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. The feminine gender indicates that the subject of the verb is a female.

Therefore, "πορευθεισα" can be translated as "she was journeyed" or "she was traveled". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the travels of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and other female characters.
