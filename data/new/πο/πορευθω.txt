Word: πορευθω

Etymology:
The word πορευθω (poreuthō) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πορεύομαι (poreuomai), which means "to go, to travel, to journey." It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *per- which means "to lead, to pass over."

Grammar:
πορευθω is a first-person singular present passive indicative form of the verb πορεύομαι (poreuomai). It is a passive form, which means that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it could be translated as "I am being led" or "I am being taken."

Description:
πορευθω is a verb that is often used in the New Testament of the Bible. It is used to describe the act of being led or taken somewhere, either physically or metaphorically. For example, in Matthew 4:19, Jesus says to his disciples, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." The Greek phrase for "follow me" is ἀκολουθεῖτέ μοι (akoloutheite moi), which is derived from the verb πορεύομαι (poreuomai). Another example is in Mark 1:38, where Jesus says, "Let us go somewhere else - to the nearby villages - so I can preach there also. That is why I have come." The Greek phrase for "let us go" is ἄγωμεν (agōmen), which is also derived from the verb πορεύομαι (poreuomai).
