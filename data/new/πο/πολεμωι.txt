I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a definition for the word "πολεμωι" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling or a variation of the word "πολέμων" which means "warrior" or "soldier" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "πολέμων" comes from the Greek verb "πολεμέω" which means "to make war" or "to fight". 

Grammar: "πολέμων" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. 

Description: "πολέμων" refers to a person who is engaged in warfare or military activities. It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is fiercely competitive or combative in other areas of life.
