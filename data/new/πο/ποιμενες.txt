Word: ποιμένες

Etymology: The word ποιμένες (poiménes) comes from the Greek verb ποιμαίνω (poimainó), which means "to shepherd" or "to tend to a flock." The word is derived from the noun ποίμνη (poímnē), which means "flock" or "herd."

Grammar: ποιμένες is a plural noun in Greek, meaning "shepherds" or "pastors." It is declined in the third declension, with the nominative singular form being ποιμήν (poimḗn).

Description: ποιμένες is a term used in the New Testament to refer to religious leaders or pastors who guide and care for their congregations, much like a shepherd tends to his flock. The term is also used metaphorically to describe Jesus as the "Good Shepherd" who watches over and protects his followers. In modern Greek, the word is still used to refer to shepherds who tend to flocks of sheep or goats.
