Sorry, I cannot define the word "πονηρωι" as it seems to be misspelled. However, if you meant "πονηρός" (poniros), which is a Greek word, here is the definition:

Etymology: From the ancient Greek word πόνος (ponos) meaning "pain" or "hardship".

Grammar: Adjective, masculine gender, singular form.

Description: The word "πονηρός" is used to describe someone or something that is wicked, evil, or malicious. It can also refer to something that is cunning or sly.
