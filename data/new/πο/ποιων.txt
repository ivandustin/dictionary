Word: ποιων

Etymology:
The word ποιων (poiōn) is a present participle of the Greek verb ποιέω (poiéō), which means "to make" or "to do". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *kʷey- which means "to make" or "to build".

Grammar:
ποιων is a present participle in the masculine singular form. It is used to describe someone who is currently making or doing something. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -ων (-ōn) to the stem of the verb.

Description:
ποιων can be translated as "making" or "doing". It is often used in Greek literature to describe someone who is actively engaged in an activity or creating something. For example, in Homer's Iliad, the word is used to describe the actions of the gods as they intervene in the affairs of mortals. In modern Greek, the word is still used in the same way, to describe someone who is actively engaged in a task or project.
