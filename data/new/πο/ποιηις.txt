I'm sorry, but the word "ποιηις" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "ποίησις" (poíēsis), which means "creation" or "poetry". 

Etymology: The word "ποίησις" comes from the Greek verb "ποιέω" (poiéō), which means "to make" or "to create". 

Grammar: "ποίησις" is a feminine noun in the nominative case. Its genitive form is "ποιήσεως" (poiḗseōs), and its accusative form is "ποίησιν" (poíēsin). 

Description: "ποίησις" refers to the act of creating or making something, particularly in the context of poetry or literature. It can also refer to the product of this act, such as a poem or a work of art. In philosophy, "ποίησις" is sometimes used to describe the process of bringing something into being, or the act of realizing an idea or concept.
