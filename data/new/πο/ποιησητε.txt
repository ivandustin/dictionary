I'm sorry, but the word "ποιησητε" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the verb "ποιήσετε" (poiísete), which means "you (plural) create/make". 

Etymology: The verb "ποιήσετε" comes from the ancient Greek verb "ποιέω" (poiéō), which means "I create/make". 

Grammar: "ποιήσετε" is the second person plural (you all) imperative form of the verb "ποιέω". 

Description: "ποιήσετε" is a command or request for a group of people to create or make something. It is often used in instructions, recipes, or artistic contexts.
