The word "πορνηι" (pronounced "porn-ee") is a Greek noun that means "prostitute" or "harlot". It is derived from the verb "πορνεύω" (pronounced "porn-yoo-oh"), which means "to prostitute oneself". In terms of grammar, "πορνηι" is a feminine noun in the dative case, which is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb. 

In ancient Greek society, prostitution was a common and accepted practice, and there were even temples dedicated to the worship of the goddess Aphrodite, who was associated with love, beauty, and sexuality. Prostitutes were often slaves or women from lower social classes who had few other options for making a living. 

Today, the word "πορνηι" is still used in modern Greek to refer to a prostitute, although it is considered a vulgar term and is not commonly used in polite conversation.
