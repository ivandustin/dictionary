The word "ποδας" (podas) is a Greek noun that means "foot" in English. It is derived from the Greek word "πούς" (pous), which also means "foot". In terms of grammar, "ποδας" is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive "ποδός" (podos) or the accusative "πόδα" (poda). 

In Greek mythology, the god Hermes wore winged sandals on his feet, which allowed him to fly. The ancient Greeks also believed that washing someone's feet was a sign of hospitality and respect. In modern Greek, "ποδας" is still commonly used to refer to the foot, and it is also used in idiomatic expressions, such as "να βάλεις τα πόδια σου" (na valeis ta podia sou), which means "to hit the road" or "to get going".
