The word ποιμνην (poimnēn) is a Greek noun that means "flock" or "herd". It is derived from the verb ποιμαίνω (poimainō), which means "to tend" or "to shepherd". The word is related to the English word "pasture", which also comes from the same root.

Grammar:
ποιμνην is a singular accusative noun in Greek. It is declined in the first declension, which means that its stem is ποιμνη- (poimnē-) and its ending is -ν (n). In Greek, the accusative case is used to indicate the direct object of a verb.
