αχαιας (Achaia in English) is a feminine noun in Greek that refers to a region in the northern part of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. The word is derived from the ancient Greek word "Achaeans," which was the name given to the people who lived in the region during the Mycenaean period. In grammar, αχαιας is declined in the first declension and has a genitive form of αχαιαδος (Achaidos).
