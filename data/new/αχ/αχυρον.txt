Etymology:
The word αχυρον (achyron) is derived from the Greek word αχυρος (achyros), which means "without chaff". It is a combination of the prefix α- (a-), which means "not", and the word χυρος (chyros), which means "chaff".

Grammar:
αχυρον is a neuter noun in the singular form. In Greek, neuter nouns have the same form for both the nominative and accusative cases. The word can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive, dative, and vocative.

Description:
αχυρον refers to the part of the grain that is left over after the threshing process. It is the outer layer of the grain that is removed before it can be used for food. In modern Greek, the word αχυρον is also used to refer to something that is of little or no value, or something that is considered to be waste or useless.
