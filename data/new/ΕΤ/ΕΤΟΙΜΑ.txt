Description: "Etymology" is the study of the origin and history of words, including their changes in form and meaning over time. It involves tracing the roots and development of words, as well as understanding their connections to other languages. Grammar, on the other hand, is the study of the structure and rules of a language, including how words are formed, how they are combined to create meaningful sentences, and how they are pronounced.
