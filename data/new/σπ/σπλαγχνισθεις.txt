Word: σπλαγχνισθεις

Etymology: The word σπλαγχνισθεις comes from the Greek verb σπλαγχνίζομαι (splagchnizomai), which means "to be moved with compassion" or "to feel pity." The root of the word is σπλάγχνα (splagchna), which means "internal organs" or "viscera." In ancient Greek culture, the heart and other internal organs were believed to be the seat of emotions, including compassion.

The participle mood indicates that the verb is functioning as an adjective, describing the subject of the sentence.

Description: σπλαγχνισθεις is a word that describes a deep feeling of compassion or pity. It is often used in religious or spiritual contexts to describe the compassion that God or a deity feels for humanity. The word suggests a visceral, gut-level response to suffering or need, rather than a detached or intellectual response. In modern usage, the word is sometimes used to describe a strong emotional response to any situation, not just one involving suffering or need.
