Description:
σπορον refers to a seed or a small, dry, hard fruit that contains the embryo of a plant. It is an important part of the process of reproduction in plants, as it contains the genetic material necessary for the growth and development of a new plant.

Seeds are also used for food, as they are a rich source of nutrients and energy.
