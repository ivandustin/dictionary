The word σπειρης (speires) is a Greek noun that means "coil" or "spiral". It is derived from the verb σπείρω (speirō), which means "to coil" or "to twist". In terms of grammar, σπειρης is a feminine noun in the nominative singular form. It can also be declined in various cases, such as genitive σπείρητος (speiretos) and accusative σπείρην (speiren). 

In ancient Greek mythology, the god Zeus was said to have taken the form of a serpent and coiled himself around the oracle at Delphi, which was known as the "navel of the world". This image of a coiled serpent became associated with wisdom and prophecy, and the word σπειρης was often used to describe this coiled shape. 

In modern usage, the word σπειρης is still used to describe a spiral or coiled shape, and can be found in scientific terms such as "spiral galaxy" or "spiral staircase".
