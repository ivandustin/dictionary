Word: σπλαγχνα

Etymology:
The word σπλαγχνα (splagchna) comes from the Greek language and is derived from the root word σπλαγχνον (splagchnon), which means "internal organs" or "viscera". It is believed to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European root *spleg-, which means "to swell" or "to be full".

Grammar:
In Greek, σπλαγχνα is a neuter noun in the plural form. It is often used in the New Testament to refer to the inward parts of a person, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and intestines. It is also used metaphorically to refer to a person's emotions, feelings, and compassion.

Description:
The word σπλαγχνα is a powerful and evocative term that conveys a sense of deep emotion and empathy. It is often used in religious and spiritual contexts to describe the compassion and mercy of God, as well as the love and kindness that people should show to one another. In modern Greek, the word is still used to refer to the internal organs of the body, but it is also used more broadly to describe a person's innermost thoughts and feelings.
