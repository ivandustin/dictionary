Word: σπειρομενοι

Etymology:
The word σπειρομενοι is derived from the Greek verb σπείρω (speírō), which means "to sow" or "to scatter." The suffix -μενοι (-menoi) is a present participle ending, indicating that the word refers to something that is currently happening or ongoing. Therefore, σπειρομενοι can be translated as "those who are sowing" or "those who are scattering."

Grammar:
σπειρομενοι is a present participle in the masculine plural form. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -ων (-ōn) to the stem of the verb. The stem of σπείρω is σπειρ-, so the present participle form is σπειροντ- (speiront-). The masculine plural ending -οι (-oi) is added to this stem to form the word σπειρομενοι.
