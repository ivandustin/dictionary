Word: σπορος

Etymology:
The word σπορος (sporos) comes from the Greek verb σπείρω (speirō), which means "to sow" or "to scatter." It is related to the English word "spore," which refers to a reproductive cell that can develop into a new organism.

Grammar:
In Greek, σπορος is a masculine noun of the second declension. Its nominative singular form is σπορος, and its genitive singular form is σπόρου. The word can also be declined in the plural, with the nominative plural form being σπόροι and the genitive plural form being σπόρων.

Description:
σπορος refers to a seed or a grain, particularly one that is used for planting or for food. In ancient Greek mythology, the goddess Demeter was associated with the growth of crops and was often depicted holding a bundle of wheat or barley, both of which are types of σπορος. The word can also be used metaphorically to refer to the beginning or origin of something, as in the phrase "the seed of an idea."
