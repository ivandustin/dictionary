Word: σπείρειν

Etymology:
The word σπείρειν (speirein) comes from the Ancient Greek verb σπείρω (speirō), which means "to sow" or "to scatter seed". This verb is derived from the noun σπέρμα (sperma), which means "seed" or "offspring".

Grammar:
σπείρειν is a present active infinitive verb in Ancient Greek. It belongs to the first conjugation, which means that its stem is formed by removing the -ω (ō) ending from the present tense stem. The stem of σπείρειν is σπειρ-, and the infinitive ending is -ειν (-ein).

Description:
σπείρειν is a verb that refers to the act of sowing or scattering seed. In Ancient Greek, this verb was commonly used in the context of agriculture, where farmers would sow seeds in their fields to grow crops. However, the verb can also be used metaphorically to refer to the act of spreading or disseminating something more broadly. For example, one might say that a teacher is "sowing the seeds of knowledge" in their students, or that a politician is "sowing the seeds of dissent" among the population.
