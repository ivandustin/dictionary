Word: οπλισασθε

Etymology: οπλισασθε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word οπλίζω (op-lí-zo), which means "to arm" or "to equip". The suffix -σασθε (-sas-the) indicates that the verb is in the aorist tense and the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Grammar: οπλισασθε is a second-person plural aorist middle imperative verb in Greek. This means that it is a command directed at a group of people (you all) to arm or equip yourselves. The aorist tense indicates that the action is completed in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: οπλισασθε is a verb that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Ephesians 6:13. In this passage, the apostle Paul is exhorting the Ephesian Christians to put on the full armor of God in order to stand against the spiritual forces of evil. The verb οπλισασθε is part of this exhortation, and it emphasizes the importance of being fully equipped and prepared for spiritual battle.
