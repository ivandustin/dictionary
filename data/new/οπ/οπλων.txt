The word "οπλων" (oplon) is a Greek noun in the genitive plural form, which means "of weapons" or "belonging to weapons". It is derived from the Greek word "όπλο" (oplo), which means "weapon". In Greek mythology, the god of war Ares was often depicted carrying various "οπλων" (weapons) such as swords, spears, and shields. In modern Greek, the word "οπλων" is still used to refer to weapons, both in a literal and figurative sense.
