Etymology: The word "ανατολή" comes from the Greek verb "ανατέλλω" (anatéllō), which means "to rise" or "to appear". In this context, it refers to the rising of the sun in the east.

Grammar: "Ανατολή" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "ανατολές" (anatolés).

Description: "Ανατολή" is a common word in Greek, used to refer to the direction of the east, as well as to the sunrise and the morning. It is also used in various expressions and idioms, such as "από την ανατολή ως τη δύση" (from east to west) and "ανατολή διαύγεια" (clear sunrise).
