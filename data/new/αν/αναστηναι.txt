Word: αναστηναι

Etymology: αναστηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix ανα- (meaning "up" or "again") and the verb στηναι (meaning "to stand"). Therefore, αναστηναι means "to stand up again" or "to rise again".

Grammar: αναστηναι is an infinitive verb in Greek, which means that it is not conjugated to match a specific subject or tense. It is often used in combination with auxiliary verbs to form compound tenses, such as the aorist tense (ανέστησα) or the present perfect tense (έχω αναστηθεί).

Description: αναστηναι is a powerful and evocative verb that is often used in religious or spiritual contexts to refer to the resurrection or the rising from the dead. It can also be used in a more general sense to describe the act of standing up or getting back on one's feet after a difficult situation. In modern Greek, it is often used in idiomatic expressions, such as "αναστήθηκε ο κόσμος" (the world woke up) or "αναστήθηκε από το κρεβάτι" (he got up from the bed).
