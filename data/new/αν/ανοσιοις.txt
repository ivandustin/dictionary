The word "ανοσιοις" (anoisiois) is a Greek adjective in the dative plural form, which means "unholy" or "impious". It is derived from the Greek word "ανόσιος" (anosios), which means "unholy" or "profane". The prefix "αν-" (an-) means "not" or "without", while the root word "όσιος" (osios) means "holy" or "sacred". Therefore, "ανοσιοις" describes something or someone that is not holy or sacred, and is often used in a religious or moral context.
