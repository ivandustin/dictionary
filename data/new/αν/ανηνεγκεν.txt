Word: ανηνεγκεν

Etymology:
The word ανηνεγκεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word αναφέρω (anaphero), which means "to carry up" or "to bring up." The prefix ανα (ana) means "up" or "again," and the verb φέρω (fero) means "to carry" or "to bring." Therefore, ανηνεγκεν can be translated as "to bring up again" or "to carry up again."
