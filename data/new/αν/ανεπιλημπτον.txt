Word: ανεπίλημπτον

Etymology:
The word ανεπίλημπτον (anepílimpton) is derived from the Greek prefix αν- (an-), meaning "not," and the verb επιλαμβάνομαι (epilambánomai), meaning "to take hold of, to seize." Therefore, ανεπίλημπτον can be translated as "unseizable" or "ungraspable."

Grammar:
ανεπίλημπτον is an adjective in the neuter gender, singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if ανεπίλημπτον were to modify a feminine or masculine noun, it would change to ανεπίληπτος (anepíliptos) or ανεπίληπτη (anepílipti), respectively.

Description:
ανεπίλημπτον is a word that describes something that cannot be seized or grasped. It can be used to describe abstract concepts, such as an idea or a feeling, or concrete objects, such as a slippery fish or a ghostly apparition. The word implies a sense of elusiveness or intangibility, suggesting that the thing being described is difficult or impossible to capture or hold onto.
