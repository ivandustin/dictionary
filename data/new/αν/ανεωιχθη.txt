Word: ανεωιχθη

Etymology:
The word ανεωιχθη is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: ανά (ana) meaning "up" or "again" and εωιχθη (eōichthē) meaning "to be opened". Therefore, the literal meaning of ανεωιχθη is "to be opened up again".

Grammar:
ανεωιχθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the prefix ανά to the verb εωιχθη, which means "to be opened". The aorist tense indicates that the action of opening occurred in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (the thing being opened) is the recipient of the action.

Description:
ανεωιχθη is a verb that describes the action of something being opened up again. It implies that the thing being opened was previously closed or sealed, and is now being opened again. This word can be used in a variety of contexts, such as opening a door that was previously closed, or opening a sealed container. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the opening up of a discussion or a relationship that was previously closed or strained.
