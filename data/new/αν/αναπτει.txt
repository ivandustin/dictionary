I'm sorry, but "αναπτει" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of "ανάπτει", which is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "ανάβω" (anavo), meaning "to light up" or "to ignite". 

Etymology: The word "ανάβω" comes from the ancient Greek verb "ἀνάπτω" (anapto), which also means "to light up" or "to kindle". 

Grammar: "ανάβω" is a regular verb in Greek, belonging to the first conjugation. Its conjugation in the present tense is as follows:

- Εγώ ανάβω (ego anavo) = I light up
- Εσύ ανάβεις (esi anaveis) = You light up
- Αυτός/Αυτή/Αυτό ανάβει (aftos/afti/afto anavei) = He/She/It lights up
- Εμείς ανάβουμε (emeis anavoume) = We light up
- Εσείς ανάβετε (eseis anavete) = You light up
- Αυτοί/Αυτές/Αυτά ανάβουν (aftoi/aftes/afta anavoun) = They light up

Description: "ανάβω" is a common verb in Greek, used in various contexts to describe the act of lighting up or igniting something. It can be used literally, as in "Ανάβω το φως" (Anavo to fos) = "I turn on the light", or figuratively, as in "Ανάβω το πάθος" (Anavo to pathos) = "I ignite the passion".
