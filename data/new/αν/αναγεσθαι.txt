Word: αναγεσθαι

Etymology:
The word αναγεσθαι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word αναγω (anago), which means "to lead up" or "to bring up". The prefix ανα (ana) means "up" or "again", and the suffix -γεσθαι (-gesthai) is a middle/passive voice ending that indicates the subject is being acted upon or is acting upon themselves.

Grammar:

In Greek, infinitives are verbal nouns that express the action or state of the verb without indicating any specific subject or tense. The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is either acting upon themselves or being acted upon by an external force.
