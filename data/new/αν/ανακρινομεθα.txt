Word: ανακρινομεθα

Etymology: ανακρινομεθα is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρίνω (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix ανα (ana) means "up" or "back", so ανακρινομεθα can be translated as "to judge again" or "to re-examine".

Grammar: ανακρινομεθα is a first-person plural present passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -μεθα (-metha) to the root word κρίνω (krino), and the prefix ανα (ana) is added to indicate the action of re-examining or judging again. The verb is in the present tense, indicating that the action is happening now, and it is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description: ανακρινομεθα is a verb that describes the act of re-examining or judging again. It can be used in a legal context to describe the process of questioning a witness or suspect again, or in a more general sense to describe the act of reconsidering or re-evaluating something. The verb is often used in the passive voice, indicating that the subject is being subjected to scrutiny or questioning rather than actively participating in it.
