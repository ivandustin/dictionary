Word: αναπαυσασθε

Etymology:
The word αναπαυσασθε is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, passive voice, and imperative mood. It is derived from the root word αναπαυω (anapauo), which means "to rest" or "to take a break." The suffix -σασθε (-sasthe) indicates the passive voice, meaning that the subject of the verb receives the action rather than performing it.

In this case, the verb is in the second person plural form, meaning that the command is directed at a group of people.

Description:

It is a command that is often used in a context where the speaker is encouraging others to relax or take a moment to rest. The passive voice of the verb emphasizes that the action of resting is something that is done to the subject, rather than something that they actively do themselves.
