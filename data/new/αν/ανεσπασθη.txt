Word: ανεσπασθη

Etymology: The word ανεσπασθη comes from the Greek verb ανασπάω (anaspaō), which means "to loosen" or "to unbind". The prefix ανα- (ana-) means "up" or "again", while the root σπα- (spa-) means "to draw tight" or "to bind". The suffix -θη (-thē) indicates that the verb is in the passive voice.

Grammar: ανεσπασθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb ανασπάω (anaspaō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: ανεσπασθη can be translated as "was loosened" or "was unbound". It describes a past event in which something or someone was released from a state of being bound or constrained. The context in which the word is used will determine the specific meaning and implications of the action.
