Word: ανεσχομην

Etymology: ανεσχομην is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix αν- (meaning "not" or "un-") and the verb εσχον (meaning "I held" or "I took"). Therefore, ανεσχομην can be translated as "I did not hold" or "I did not take".

Grammar: ανεσχομην is a first-person singular aorist middle indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, ανεσχομην can be translated as "I did not hold myself" or "I did not take myself".

Description: ανεσχομην is a reflexive verb that expresses the idea of refraining from doing something. It is often used in a negative context to indicate that the subject did not do something that was expected or required of them. For example, ανεσχομην να πω την αλήθεια (aneshomēn na pō tēn alētheia) means "I refrained from telling the truth" or "I did not tell the truth".
