Etymology: The word "αναστροφή" comes from the Greek verb "αναστρέφω" (anastrefo), which means "to turn back" or "to reverse." 

Grammar: "Αναστροφή" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "αναστροφές" (anastrofes). 

Description: "Αναστροφή" can be used in various contexts, such as in physics to describe the reversal of a process, in linguistics to describe the inversion of word order in a sentence, or in everyday language to describe a change in direction or a U-turn.
