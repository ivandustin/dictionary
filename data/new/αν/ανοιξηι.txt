I'm sorry, but the word "ανοιξηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "ανοιξη" (anoixi), which means "spring" in English. 

Etymology: The word "ανοιξη" comes from the ancient Greek word "ἄνοιξις" (anoixis), which means "opening" or "unsealing". It refers to the opening of flowers and the beginning of the spring season.

Grammar: "Ανοιξη" is a feminine noun in Greek and belongs to the first declension. Its plural form is "ανοίξεις" (anoixeis).

Description: "Ανοιξη" is a beautiful and important season in Greece, as it marks the end of winter and the beginning of warmer weather. It is associated with the blooming of flowers, the singing of birds, and the renewal of nature. Greeks celebrate the arrival of spring with various customs and traditions, such as the burning of effigies on Clean Monday, the dyeing of eggs on Easter, and the picking of wildflowers on May Day.
