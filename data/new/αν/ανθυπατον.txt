Word: ανθυπατον

Etymology:
The word ανθυπατον (anthypaton) is derived from the Greek words αντί (anti) meaning "against" or "opposite" and υπατος (hypatos) meaning "consul" or "governor". Therefore, ανθυπατον can be translated as "vice-consul" or "deputy governor".

Grammar:
ανθυπατον is a neuter noun in the singular form. In Greek, neuter nouns have the same form for both the nominative and accusative cases. Therefore, ανθυπατον can be used as both the subject and object of a sentence.

Description:

This title was used in the Roman Empire as well, where it referred to a governor of a province who was second in command to the governor. The ανθυπατον was responsible for assisting the governor in his duties and could act as his representative in his absence.
