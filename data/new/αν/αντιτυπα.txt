Word: αντιτυπα

Etymology:
The word αντιτυπα (antitypa) is derived from the Greek words αντί (anti) meaning "against" or "opposite" and τύπος (typos) meaning "impression" or "print". Therefore, the word αντιτυπα can be translated as "counterprints" or "opposite impressions".

Grammar:
In Greek, αντιτυπα is a plural noun. It belongs to the third declension and its gender is neuter. The singular form of the word is αντίτυπο (antitypo).

Description:
The word αντιτυπα is used to refer to copies or reproductions of an original document or artwork that are made in reverse. This means that the image or text on the copy is a mirror image of the original. Antitypa were commonly used in printing before the advent of digital technology. They were created by placing the original document or artwork face down on a metal plate coated with a light-sensitive emulsion. The plate was then exposed to light, which caused the emulsion to harden in the areas where the original was not blocking the light. The plate was then developed and used to print copies of the original in reverse. Today, the term αντιτυπα is also used more broadly to refer to any kind of copy or reproduction, whether it is made in reverse or not.
