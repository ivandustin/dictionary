The word "ανεξονται" (anexontai) is a verb in the Greek language. 

Etymology: The word is derived from the prefix "αν-" (an-), which means "not" or "un-", and the verb "έχω" (echo), which means "to have". Therefore, "ανεξονται" means "they do not have" or "they are without".

Grammar: The word is in the present tense, third person plural form. It is a passive verb, indicating that the subject is not performing the action, but rather is being acted upon. 

Description: The word is often used in a negative context to describe a lack or absence of something. For example, "Οι φτωχοί ανεξονται πολλών πραγμάτων" (Oi ftochoi anexontai pollon pragmaton) means "The poor do not have many things".
