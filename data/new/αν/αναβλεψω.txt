Word: αναβλέπω (anablepso)

Etymology: The word αναβλέπω comes from the combination of two Greek words: ανα (ana) meaning "up" or "again" and βλέπω (blepo) meaning "to see". Therefore, αναβλέπω means "to look up" or "to see again".

Grammar: αναβλέπω is a verb in the present tense, active voice, and indicative mood. It belongs to the first conjugation of Greek verbs, which means that its stem is formed by the first person singular of the present tense (αναβλέπω - anablepo) and its endings are added to this stem.

Description: αναβλέπω means "to look up" or "to raise one's eyes". It can also be used figuratively to mean "to reconsider" or "to reflect on". The word is often used in a religious context to describe the act of looking up to God or seeking divine guidance.
