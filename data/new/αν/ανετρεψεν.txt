The word "ανετρεψεν" (anetrepsen) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, which means it refers to a completed action in the past. It is derived from the root word "τρέπω" (trepo), which means "to turn" or "to change direction". The prefix "αν-" (an-) in this case indicates a reversal or a turning back.

In terms of grammar, "ανετρεψεν" is a third-person singular verb, meaning it refers to a single subject who performed the action. It is in the indicative mood, which indicates a statement of fact.

The word can be translated to English as "turned over", "overturned", or "upset". It can be used in a literal sense, such as a boat being overturned in the water, or in a figurative sense, such as a political situation being overturned or a person's life being turned upside down.
