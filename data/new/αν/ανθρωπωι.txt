I'm sorry, but the word "ανθρωπωι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "ανθρωπος" (anthropos), which means "human" or "person". 

Etymology: The word "ανθρωπος" comes from the Greek roots "ανθρωπ-" (anthrop-) meaning "human" and "-ος" (-os) which is a suffix used to form nouns. 

Grammar: "Ανθρωπος" is a masculine noun in Greek and its plural form is "ανθρωποι" (anthropoi). 

Description: "Ανθρωπος" is a common word in Greek and is used to refer to any human being, regardless of gender. It can also be used in a more general sense to refer to humanity as a whole.
