Word: ανεπαυσαν

Etymology: ανεπαυσαν is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix αν- (meaning "not" or "un-") and the verb επαυσαν (meaning "they rested" or "they stopped"). Therefore, ανεπαυσαν means "they did not rest" or "they did not stop".

Grammar: ανεπαυσαν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb αναπαύω (anapauo), which means "to rest" or "to refresh oneself". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.

Description: ανεπαυσαν is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Luke (23:56). The passage describes how the women who had followed Jesus from Galilee went to his tomb after his crucifixion and "rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment". However, the verb ανεπαυσαν is used to indicate that they did not rest completely, as they were planning to return to the tomb after the Sabbath to anoint Jesus' body with spices. Therefore, the word conveys a sense of incompleteness or unfinished business.
