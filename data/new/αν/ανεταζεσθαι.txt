The word "ανεταζεσθαι" (anetazesthai) is a Greek verb that means "to stretch oneself out, to recline." It is derived from the prefix "ana-" meaning "up" or "back" and the verb "τάζω" (tazo) meaning "to stretch." In grammar, it is a middle/passive voice verb, meaning that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. 

In ancient Greek culture, reclining at meals was a common practice, and the verb "ανεταζεσθαι" was often used to describe this action. It was also used in literature to describe a relaxed or comfortable posture.
