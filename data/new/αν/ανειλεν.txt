The word "ανειλεν" (aneilen) is a verb in the Greek language. It is the aorist tense of the verb "αναιρεω" (anaireo), which means "to take up, lift up, remove, destroy, kill, or slay". The word is composed of two parts: "ανα" (ana), which means "up" or "again", and "ειλεν" (eilen), which is the aorist tense of the verb "αιρω" (airo), meaning "to lift up" or "to take away". Therefore, "ανειλεν" can be translated as "lifted up again" or "took away again" in English. The word is commonly used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
