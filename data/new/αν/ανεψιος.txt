Word: ανεψιος

Etymology: The word ανεψιος (anesios) comes from the Greek word ανεψιός (anesiós), which means "nephew" or "niece". It is derived from the prefix αν- (an-), meaning "not", and the word εψιός (epsiós), meaning "cousin".

Grammar: ανεψιος is a masculine noun in Greek. It is declined like the noun οδος (odos), which means "road". The plural form of ανεψιος is ανεψιοι (anesioi).

Description: ανεψιος refers to a nephew or niece, which is the child of one's brother or sister. In Greek culture, family is highly valued, and the relationship between an uncle or aunt and their nieces and nephews is considered very important. The word can also be used more broadly to refer to any relative who is in the same generation as one's parents, such as a cousin.
