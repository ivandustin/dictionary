The word "ανατεταλκεν" is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the Greek verb "ανατέλλω" (anatélo), which means "to rise" or "to appear". 

Etymology: The word comes from the combination of the prefix "ανα-" (ana-), which means "up" or "again", and the verb "τέλλω" (télo), which means "to bring forth" or "to produce". 

Grammar: "ανατέλλω" is a regular verb in Greek, belonging to the first conjugation. In the present tense, it is conjugated as follows:

- Ανατέλλει (anatélei) - He/she/it rises
- Ανατελλούμε (anatellóume) - We rise
- Ανατέλλετε (anatéllete) - You (plural) rise
