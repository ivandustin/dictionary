Word: ανεγνωσαν

Etymology: ανεγνωσαν is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix αν- (meaning "up" or "again") and the verb γνωστικός (meaning "to know"). Therefore, ανεγνωσαν means "they read again" or "they read thoroughly".

Grammar: ανεγνωσαν is the third person plural aorist indicative active form of the verb αναγινώσκω (anaginósko), which means "to read". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the indicative mood indicates a statement of fact.

Description: ανεγνωσαν is a verb that describes the action of reading thoroughly or reading again. It is often used in the context of studying or analyzing a text. The word can be broken down into two parts: αν- (meaning "up" or "again") and εγνωσαν (the third person plural form of the verb γινώσκω, meaning "to know"). Therefore, the word implies a sense of revisiting or gaining a deeper understanding of something through reading.
