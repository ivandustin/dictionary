Word: αναμνησθεις

Etymology:
The word αναμνησθεις comes from the Greek verb αναμιμνησκω (anamimnēskō), which means "to remember, to recall". It is derived from the prefix ανα- (ana-), meaning "again" or "back", and the verb μιμνησκω (mimnēskō), meaning "to remember".

Grammar:
αναμνησθεις is a second person singular aorist active participle of the verb αναμιμνησκω (anamimnēskō). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the participle form indicates that the verb is being used as an adjective.

Description:
αναμνησθεις can be translated as "having remembered" or "having recalled". It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe a moment when someone remembers something important, such as a promise or a prophecy. The word implies a sudden realization or a flash of insight, rather than a gradual process of recollection.
