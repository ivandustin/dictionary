Word: ανωφελεις

Etymology:
The word ανωφελεις (anopheleis) is derived from the Greek word ανωφελής (anophelis), which means "useless" or "unprofitable". It is composed of two parts: ανω (ano), meaning "above" or "higher", and φελος (phelos), meaning "profit" or "advantage". Therefore, the word ανωφελεις can be translated as "above profit" or "beyond advantage".

Grammar:
ανωφελεις is an adjective in the masculine plural form. It is used to describe something or someone that is useless or unprofitable. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, if we want to describe a group of useless things, we would use the word ανωφελεις in the masculine plural form: ανωφελείς πράγματα (anopheleis pragmata).

Description:
The word ανωφελεις is often used to describe things or actions that have no practical value or benefit. It can be used to describe a person who is lazy or unproductive, or a situation that is pointless or futile. For example, if someone spends their entire day watching TV instead of doing something productive, we could say that they are ανωφελεις. Similarly, if a company invests a lot of money in a project that ultimately fails, we could describe the project as ανωφελεις. Overall, the word ανωφελεις is a useful term for describing things that are not worth our time or effort.
