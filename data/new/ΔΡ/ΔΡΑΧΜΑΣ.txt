Grammar: In Greek, "δραχμας" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It is the singular form of the word, and its plural form is "δραχμές" (drachmes).

Description: "Δραχμας" refers to the currency unit used in Greece before the introduction of the euro. It was the official currency of Greece from ancient times until 2002 when it was replaced by the euro. The drachma was subdivided into smaller units, such as the obol and the lepton.
