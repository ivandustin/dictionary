The word "βλασφημηται" (blasphēmētai) is a Greek verb in the present tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. It is derived from the root word "βλασφημέω" (blasphēmeō), which means to speak evil of, slander, or revile.

In Greek grammar, the present tense indicates that the action is happening currently or repeatedly. The passive voice indicates that the subject is receiving the action, rather than performing it. The indicative mood is used to make a statement or ask a question.

Therefore, "βλασφημηται" means "they are being blasphemed" or "they are being slandered." It is often used in a religious context to refer to the act of speaking disrespectfully or irreverently about God or sacred things.
