Word: βλεποντες

Etymology: βλεποντες is a present participle form of the Greek verb βλέπω (blepō), which means "to see" or "to look". The word is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *bʰel- ("to shine, flash, gleam").

Grammar: βλεποντες is a present participle in the masculine nominative plural form. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the present stem of the verb. They function as adjectives and describe an ongoing action or state. In this case, βλεποντες means "those who are seeing" or "those who are looking".

Description: βλεποντες is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Mark (Mark 9:8). It is used to describe the disciples of Jesus who witnessed his transfiguration on a mountain. The word emphasizes the visual aspect of the event and the disciples' role as observers. In modern Greek, βλεποντες is still used as a present participle to describe someone who is currently seeing or looking at something.
