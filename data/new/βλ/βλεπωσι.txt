Sorry, I cannot provide a definition for the word "βλεπωσι" as it is not a valid Greek word. The correct spelling is "βλέπουσι" which is the third person plural present indicative active form of the Greek verb "βλέπω" (blepó) meaning "they see". 

Etymology: The word "βλέπω" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *bʰel- meaning "to shine, flash, gleam". 

Grammar: βλέπουσι is a verb in the present tense, indicative mood, active voice, and third person plural. 

Description: βλέπουσι is used to describe an action of seeing or observing that is currently happening in the present.
