Word: βλεποντας

Etymology: βλεποντας is a present participle form of the Greek verb βλέπω (blepó), which means "to see" or "to look". The word comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *bʰel- ("to shine, flash, gleam").

Grammar: βλεποντας is a present participle in the active voice, masculine gender, and nominative case. It is formed by adding the suffix -ντας (-ntas) to the present stem βλεπ- (blep-). The present participle is used to describe an ongoing action or state that is happening at the same time as the main verb.

Description: βλεποντας can be translated as "seeing" or "looking". It is often used in Greek to describe someone who is currently looking at something or someone. For example, "Βλέποντας το βιβλίο, διάβαζε" (Bleponas to vivlio, diavaze) means "While looking at the book, he was reading". The word can also be used as an adjective to describe someone who has good eyesight or is observant.
