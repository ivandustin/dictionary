The word "βληθησεται" is a Greek verb in the future passive indicative tense. It comes from the root word "βάλλω" (ballō), which means "to throw" or "to cast". The prefix "βλη-" (blē-) is a variation of "βάλλω" and adds emphasis to the action of throwing. The suffix "-θησεται" (-thēsetai) indicates that the verb is in the future tense and passive voice, meaning that the subject will be acted upon rather than performing the action themselves. Therefore, "βληθησεται" can be translated to mean "it will be thrown" or "it will be cast".
