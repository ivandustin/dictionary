Etymology: The word "κεκρατηκέναι" comes from the Greek verb "κρατέω" (kratéo), which means "to rule" or "to have power". The prefix "κε-" indicates perfect tense, and the suffix "-κέναι" indicates passive voice. Therefore, "κεκρατηκέναι" can be translated as "to have been ruled" or "to have been controlled".

Grammar: "κεκρατηκέναι" is the perfect passive infinitive form of the verb "κρατέω". In Greek grammar, the perfect tense is used to indicate a completed action in the past with ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: "κεκρατηκέναι" is a verb form that describes the state of having been ruled or controlled. It implies that someone or something has exerted power or authority over the subject. The use of the perfect tense suggests that this control or rule has occurred in the past and continues to have an impact in the present.
