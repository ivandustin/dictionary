Etymology: The word "κεκληται" comes from the Greek verb "καλέω" (kaleo), which means "to call" or "to name." The prefix "κε-" indicates perfect tense, and the suffix "-ται" indicates the passive voice. Therefore, "κεκληται" can be translated as "has been called" or "has been named."

Grammar: "κεκληται" is a third-person singular form of the verb "καλέω" in the perfect passive tense. In Greek grammar, the perfect tense is used to indicate an action that has been completed in the past with ongoing results in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: "κεκληται" is a word used in Greek to describe something or someone that has been called or named by someone else. It implies that the action of calling or naming has been completed in the past, and the subject is now known by the name given to them.
