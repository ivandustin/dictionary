Word: κινναμωμον

Etymology:
The word κινναμωμον (kinnamōmon) comes from the Greek language. It is a compound word made up of two words: κιννάμωμον (kinnamōmon) and μώμος (mōmos). The first part of the word, κιννάμωμον, means "cinnamon" and comes from the Hebrew word קִנָּמוֹן (qinnāmōn). The second part of the word, μώμος, means "blemish" or "defect". Therefore, κινναμωμον literally means "cinnamon with a defect" or "imperfect cinnamon".

Grammar:
κινναμωμον is a neuter noun in the singular form. In Greek, neuter nouns have the same form for both the nominative and accusative cases. The word can be declined as follows:

Nominative/Accusative: κινναμωμον
Genitive: κινναμωμου
Dative: κινναμωμῳ
Vocative: κινναμωμον

Description:
