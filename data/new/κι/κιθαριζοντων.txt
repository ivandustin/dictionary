Word: κιθαριζοντων

Etymology: The word κιθαριζοντων is derived from the Greek word κιθάρα (kithara), which means a stringed musical instrument. The suffix -ζων (-zon) is a present participle ending, indicating that the word is describing a group of people who are currently playing the kithara.

Grammar: κιθαριζοντων is a present participle in the genitive case, which means it is describing a group of people who are currently playing the kithara. The genitive case indicates possession or association, so κιθαριζοντων can be translated as "of those who are playing the kithara."

Description: κιθαριζοντων is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in 1 Corinthians 14:7. In this passage, the apostle Paul is discussing the importance of speaking in tongues and prophesying in the church. He uses the example of musical instruments, saying that if a trumpet does not give a clear sound, who will prepare for battle? Similarly, if someone speaks in tongues or prophesies but does not speak clearly, how will anyone understand what is being said? Paul then asks, "And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church." (1 Corinthians 14:7-12, KJV)
