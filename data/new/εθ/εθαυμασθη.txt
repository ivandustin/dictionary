Word: εθαυμασθη

Etymology: The word εθαυμασθη comes from the Greek verb θαυμάζω (thaumazo), which means "to marvel, wonder, or be amazed." The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the passive voice.

Grammar: εθαυμασθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb θαυμάζω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action of the verb, rather than performing it.

Description: εθαυμασθη can be translated as "he/she/it was amazed" or "he/she/it marveled." It is used to describe a state of wonder or astonishment that someone or something experienced. For example, in the New Testament, the word is used to describe the reaction of the people who witnessed Jesus healing a paralyzed man (Mark 2:12): "And he arose, and immediately took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
