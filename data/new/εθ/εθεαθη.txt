Word: εθεαθη

Etymology: The word εθεαθη comes from the Greek verb θεάομαι (theaomai), which means "to see, to observe, to contemplate". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the passive voice, meaning "to be seen, to be observed, to be contemplated".

Grammar: εθεαθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb θεάομαι (theaomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: εθεαθη can be translated as "was seen" or "was observed". It is often used in the New Testament to describe miraculous events, such as the transfiguration of Jesus, where it is said that "his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light" and "suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!'" (Matthew 17:2,5). In this context, εθεαθη emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event and the fact that it was witnessed by others.
