Word: εθανατωθητε

Etymology: The word εθανατωθητε is derived from the Greek word θανατός (thanatos) which means death. The prefix ε- (e-) means "to" or "towards", and the suffix -θητε (-thete) is a second person plural passive imperative ending. Therefore, εθανατωθητε means "be put to death" or "be killed".

Grammar: εθανατωθητε is a second person plural passive imperative verb form in Greek. It is used to give a command or order to a group of people to be put to death or killed. The passive voice indicates that the action is being done to the subject, rather than the subject doing the action.

It is often used in contexts such as war, crime, or punishment, where the consequences of not following the order can be severe.
