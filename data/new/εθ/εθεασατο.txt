Word: εθεασατο

Etymology: The word εθεασατο (etheasato) is a third person singular aorist middle indicative form of the Greek verb θεάομαι (theaomai), which means "to look at, behold, observe". The verb θεάομαι comes from the noun θέα (thea), which means "a view, a sight, a spectacle".

Grammar: εθεασατο is a verb form in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. It is in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, the subject is third person singular, which means that the action was performed by a single person or thing.

Description: εθεασατο can be translated as "he/she/it looked at, beheld, observed". It is a past tense form, so it refers to an action that has already happened. The middle voice indicates that the subject was both the doer and the receiver of the action, so εθεασατο implies that the subject was actively engaged in the act of looking.
