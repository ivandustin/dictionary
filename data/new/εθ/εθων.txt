Grammar: εθων is a noun in the masculine gender and singular number. It is in the nominative case, which is the case used for the subject of a sentence.

Description: εθων is a rare word that appears only once in the New Testament, in Mark 14:51-52. It is used to describe a young man who was following Jesus when he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane. The exact meaning of the word is uncertain, but it is generally thought to refer to a linen cloth or garment that was worn as an undergarment.
