Word: εθυμωθη

Etymology: The word εθυμωθη comes from the Greek verb θυμόω (thymóo), which means "to be angry" or "to rage". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a change of state or condition, so εθυμωθη can be translated as "became angry" or "was enraged".

Grammar: εθυμωθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb θυμόω. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it could be translated as "he/she/it was angered".

It is often used in the context of a sudden outburst of emotion or a reaction to a perceived injustice or offense. The word can also be used to describe a state of being angry or resentful over a longer period of time.
