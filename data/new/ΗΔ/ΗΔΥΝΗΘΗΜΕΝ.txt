The word "ηδυνηθημεν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, passive voice, and first person plural form. It comes from the root verb "ηδύνομαι" (idýnomai), which means "to be able" or "to have the power." The verb is formed by adding the suffix "-θη-" (-thē-) to the stem "ηδυνη-" (idynē-), and then conjugating it in the past tense, passive voice, and first person plural form. In English, it can be translated as "we were able" or "we had the power."
