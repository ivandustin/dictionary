Etymology: The word "απειπαμεθα" comes from the Greek verb "απειπομαι" (apeipomai), which means "to renounce" or "to give up." It is derived from the prefix "απο-" (apo-), meaning "away" or "from," and the verb "ειπον" (eipon), meaning "to say" or "to speak."

Grammar: "Απειπαμεθα" is the first person plural, aorist middle voice form of the verb "απειπομαι" (apeipomai). The aorist tense indicates a past action, and the middle voice suggests that the subject is performing the action on themselves or for their own benefit.

Description: "Απειπαμεθα" can be translated as "we renounced" or "we gave up" in English. It implies that a group of people decided to abandon or relinquish something. The context would determine what exactly was renounced or given up.
