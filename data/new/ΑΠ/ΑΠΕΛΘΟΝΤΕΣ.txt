Grammar: "απελθοντες" is the present participle form of the verb "απέρχομαι" (apérchomai). In Greek grammar, the present participle is used to describe ongoing actions or states. It is formed by adding the suffix "-οντ-" (-ont-) to the verb stem and attaching the appropriate ending. In this case, the ending "-ες" (-es) indicates the masculine plural form.
