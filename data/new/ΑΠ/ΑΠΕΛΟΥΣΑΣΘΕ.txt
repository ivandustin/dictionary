Etymology: The word "απελούσασθε" comes from the Greek verb "απολούω" (apoloúo), which means "to wash off" or "to cleanse." It is derived from the prefix "απο-" (apo-), meaning "away" or "off," and the verb "λούω" (loúo), meaning "to wash."

Grammar: "Απελούσασθε" is the second person plural, middle voice, imperfect tense form of the verb "απολούω" (apoloúo). In Greek grammar, the middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on itself or for its own benefit. The imperfect tense denotes an ongoing or repeated action in the past.

Description: "Απελούσασθε" can be translated as "you were washing off" or "you were cleansing yourselves." It implies that the subject (second person plural) was engaged in the act of washing or cleansing themselves in the past.
