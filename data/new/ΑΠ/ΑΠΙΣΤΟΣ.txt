Etymology: The word "απιστος" (apistos) comes from the Greek language. It is derived from the prefix "α-" (a-), meaning "not," and the word "πιστος" (pistos), meaning "faithful" or "trustworthy." Therefore, "απιστος" can be translated as "unfaithful" or "untrustworthy."

Grammar: In Greek, "απιστος" is an adjective. It agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if used to describe a masculine singular noun, it would be "απιστος" (apistos), while for a feminine singular noun, it would be "απιστη" (apisti), and for a neuter singular noun, it would be "απιστο" (apisto). In the plural form, it becomes "απιστοι" (apistoi) for masculine, "απιστες" (apistes) for feminine, and "απιστα" (apista) for neuter.
