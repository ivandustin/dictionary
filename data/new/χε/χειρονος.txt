The word "χειρονος" (cheironos) is a Greek adjective that means "worse" or "inferior". 

Etymology: The word is derived from the Greek words "χείρ" (cheir), meaning "hand", and "νόσος" (nosos), meaning "disease". The combination of these two words gives the meaning of "handicapped" or "afflicted with a disease of the hand".

Grammar: "χειρονος" is a comparative adjective, meaning it is used to compare two things. It is the comparative form of the adjective "κακός" (kakos), which means "bad" or "evil". 

Description: The word "χειρονος" is often used in Greek literature and philosophy to describe a situation or condition that is worse than another. It can also be used to describe a person who is inferior or less capable than another. In modern Greek, the word is still used in the same way, often in the context of sports or competition to describe a team or player that is performing poorly.
