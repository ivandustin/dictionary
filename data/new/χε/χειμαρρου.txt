The word "χειμαρρου" (cheimarrhou) is a Greek noun that refers to a torrent or a stream that flows rapidly and violently, especially during the winter season. 

Etymology: The word is derived from the combination of two Greek words, "χειμών" (cheimon) meaning winter and "άρρην" (arrin) meaning stream.

Grammar: The word "χειμαρρου" is in the genitive case, which is used to show possession or relationship between two nouns. It is often used in phrases such as "του χειμαρρού" (tou cheimarrhou) meaning "of the torrent/stream".

Description: A χειμαρρου is a natural watercourse that is characterized by its fast and turbulent flow, especially during the winter season when there is a lot of rainfall or snowmelt. It can be found in mountainous or hilly areas and can be dangerous to cross or navigate during periods of heavy flow. However, it also plays an important role in the ecosystem by transporting nutrients and sediment downstream and providing habitats for aquatic plants and animals.
