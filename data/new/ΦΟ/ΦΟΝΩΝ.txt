Description: In physics, a phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy in a crystal lattice or a collective excitation of atomic vibrations. Phonons play a crucial role in the study of the thermal and mechanical properties of solids. They are considered as quasiparticles, similar to how photons are quanta of light. Phonons can be thought of as the elementary particles of sound and heat in solids.
