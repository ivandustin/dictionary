λογομαχίας (logomachias) is a Greek word that is composed of two parts: λόγος (logos) meaning "word" or "speech" and μάχη (machi) meaning "battle" or "fight". Therefore, λογομαχίας can be translated as "word battle" or "verbal dispute". 

In terms of grammar, λογομαχίας is a noun in the genitive case, which means it is used to show possession or relationship to another noun or pronoun. 

In ancient Greece, λογομαχίας was a common practice in philosophical and political debates, where individuals would engage in verbal disputes to defend their ideas and beliefs. Today, the term is still used to describe any argument or debate that is primarily focused on the use of language and rhetoric.
