Etymology: λογισασθαι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word λόγος (logos), meaning "word" or "reason". The suffix -σασθαι (-sasthai) indicates a reflexive action, so λογισασθαι means "to reason with oneself" or "to calculate".

Grammar: λογισασθαι is a second aorist middle infinitive verb in Ancient Greek. The middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on themselves, and the aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past.

It is often used in a mathematical or financial context, but can also refer to reasoning or considering a matter. In the New Testament, it is used to describe the act of counting the cost of discipleship (Luke 14:28) or reckoning oneself dead to sin (Romans 6:11).
