Word: λογισθηναι

Etymology:
The word λογισθηναι comes from the Greek verb λογίζομαι (logizomai), which means "to reckon, calculate, or consider." It is derived from the noun λόγος (logos), which means "word, reason, or account."

Grammar:
λογισθηναι is a verb in the aorist passive infinitive form. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on tense, voice, mood, and person. The aorist tense refers to a past action that is viewed as a single event. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action. The infinitive form is the basic form of the verb that does not indicate tense, person, or number.

Description:
λογισθηναι means "to be reckoned, counted, or considered." It is often used in a financial or accounting context, but can also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of calculation or evaluation. The passive voice suggests that the subject is being evaluated or considered by someone else. For example, in the New Testament, the word is used to describe how Abraham's faith was "counted" or "credited" to him as righteousness (Romans 4:3).
