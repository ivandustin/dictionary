Description: Chalcedon was an ancient Greek city located on the Asian side of the Bosporus Strait, opposite Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul). It was founded in the 7th century BC by Megarian colonists. Chalcedon played a significant role in ancient history and was known for its strategic location and trade routes. It was also the site of important historical events, such as the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD, which defined the nature of Christ in Christian theology. Today, the area where Chalcedon once stood is part of the modern city of Istanbul.
