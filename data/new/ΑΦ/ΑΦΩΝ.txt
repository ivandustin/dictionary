Etymology: The word "αφων" (aphon) comes from the Greek word "αφωνος" (aphonos), which means "voiceless" or "mute". It is derived from the prefix "α-" (a-), meaning "without", and the word "φωνη" (phoni), meaning "voice" or "sound".

Grammar: In Greek grammar, "αφων" (aphon) is an adjective that describes nouns or pronouns that do not have a voice or sound. It is used to indicate that something is silent or mute.

Description: "αφων" (aphon) is a term used in linguistics to describe sounds that are produced without the vocal cords vibrating. These sounds are typically consonants, such as "p", "t", or "s", which are produced by blocking or restricting the airflow in the vocal tract. In contrast, sounds produced with vocal cord vibration are called "voiced" sounds.
