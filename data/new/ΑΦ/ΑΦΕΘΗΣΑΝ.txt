Etymology: The word "αφεθησαν" (aphethesan) comes from the Greek verb "αφίημι" (aphiemi), which means "to let go" or "to release". It is derived from the combination of the prefix "απο-" (apo-), meaning "away" or "from", and the verb "ιημι" (iemi), meaning "to send" or "to let". 

Grammar: "αφεθησαν" is the third person plural, aorist passive indicative form of the verb "αφίημι" (aphiemi). The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. In this case, "αφεθησαν" means "they were let go" or "they were released".

Description: "αφεθησαν" is a Greek word that describes an action of being let go or released. It can be used in various contexts, such as when referring to prisoners being set free, objects being released from someone's grasp, or even metaphorically to describe the release of emotions or burdens.
