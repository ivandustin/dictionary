The word "σωτηρα" (sotira) is a feminine noun in Greek that means "savior" or "deliverer". It comes from the verb "σῴζω" (sozo), which means "to save" or "to rescue". In Greek mythology, the goddess Athena was sometimes referred to as "σωτηρία" (soteria), meaning "savior" or "protector". In grammar, "σωτηρα" is declined in the nominative case as "η σωτηρα" (i sotira) and in the accusative case as "την σωτηρα" (tin sotira).
