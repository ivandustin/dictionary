Word: σωτηρία (soteria)

Etymology: The word σωτηρία comes from the Greek root word σωτήρ (soter), which means "savior" or "deliverer." The suffix -ία (-ia) is a common Greek suffix used to form abstract nouns, so σωτηρία can be translated as "salvation" or "deliverance."

Grammar: σωτηρία is a feminine noun in Greek, and it is declined like other first-declension nouns. The genitive form is σωτηρίας (soterias), the accusative form is σωτηρίαν (soterian), and the nominative plural form is σωτηρίες (soteries).
