The word "σωθω" (sōthō) is a Greek verb that means "to save" or "to be saved." It is derived from the root word "σωτήρ" (sōtēr), which means "savior" or "deliverer." In terms of grammar, "σωθω" is a first-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb. This means that it indicates a completed action in the past, and that the subject (in this case, "I") did not perform the action, but rather received it. Overall, "σωθω" is a powerful and important word in Greek, often used in religious and spiritual contexts to refer to salvation and redemption.
