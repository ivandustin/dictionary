The word "σωματι" (sōmati) is a Greek noun that means "body" or "physical form." It is derived from the Greek word "σῶμα" (sōma), which also means "body." In terms of grammar, "σωματι" is in the dative case, which is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb or the object of certain prepositions. 

In Greek mythology, the concept of the "soma" was often associated with the idea of the soul or spirit being housed within the physical body. The word has also been used in various philosophical and religious contexts to refer to the physical body as a vessel for the soul or as a temporary, mortal form that is distinct from the eternal soul.
