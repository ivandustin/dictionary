Word: σωιζομενους

Grammar: σωιζομενους is a present participle in the masculine, plural, accusative case. It is derived from the verb σῴζω (sōzō), which is a first conjugation verb in Greek.

Description: σωιζομενους is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Acts (2:47), to describe those who were being saved or rescued by God.
