ηνεωιγμένη (eneōigménē) is a Greek word that is the feminine form of the past participle of the verb "eneōigeō," which means "to open." It is often translated as "opened" or "unsealed" in English. In the New Testament, it is used to describe a scroll that has been unsealed or opened (Revelation 5:2, 5:5, 6:1, 6:3, 8:1). In Greek grammar, it is a perfect passive participle, indicating that the action of opening has been completed in the past and the subject of the verb (usually a scroll or book) has been opened or unsealed.
