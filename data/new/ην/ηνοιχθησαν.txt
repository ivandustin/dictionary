Word: ηνοιχθησαν

Etymology: ηνοιχθησαν is a Greek word that comes from the verb ανοίγω (anoigo), which means "to open". The prefix ην- (en-) is a form of the verb είμαι (eimai), which means "to be". Therefore, ηνοιχθησαν literally means "they were opened".

Grammar: ηνοιχθησαν is a third-person plural aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense refers to a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "they") received the action of the verb rather than performing it themselves.

Description: ηνοιχθησαν is a verb that describes the action of something being opened. It is often used in the context of doors, windows, or other physical objects that can be opened. In the New Testament of the Bible, ηνοιχθησαν is used to describe the opening of the heavens or the opening of the eyes of the blind.
