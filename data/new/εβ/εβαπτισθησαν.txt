Description:
εβαπτισθησαν is the Greek verb for "they were baptized." It is commonly used in the New Testament to describe the act of being baptized in water as a symbol of one's faith in Jesus Christ. The word emphasizes the idea of immersion or submersion in water, rather than simply pouring or sprinkling water on someone. The act of baptism is seen as a public declaration of one's commitment to follow Jesus and to be identified with his death, burial, and resurrection.
