Word: εβασιλευσεν

Etymology: 
The word εβασιλευσεν (ebasileusen) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word βασιλεύω (basileuo), which means "to reign" or "to rule." The prefix ε- (e-) is a past tense marker, indicating that the action of the verb has already taken place. Therefore, εβασιλευσεν means "he/she/it reigned" or "he/she/it ruled" in the past tense.

Grammar:
εβασιλευσεν is a third-person singular verb in the aorist tense. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. The verb is conjugated in the indicative mood, which is used to make statements or ask questions. 

Description:
εβασιλευσεν is a verb that describes an action that has already taken place in the past. It is often used in historical or narrative contexts to describe the reign or rule of a particular person or group. For example, in the New Testament, the verb is used to describe the reign of King Herod (Matthew 2:1). In modern Greek, the verb is still used to describe the act of reigning or ruling, but it is also used more broadly to describe any kind of leadership or authority.
