Word: εβαπτισθημεν

Etymology: The word εβαπτισθημεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word βαπτίζω (baptizó), which means "to dip, immerse, or submerge." The prefix ε- (e-) indicates that the action is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Grammar: εβαπτισθημεν is the third person plural form of the aorist passive indicative tense of βαπτίζω. This tense indicates a completed action in the past that was done to the subject. The -θη- (-the-) suffix indicates the passive voice, and the -μεν (-men) ending indicates that the subject is plural.

Description: εβαπτισθημεν means "they were baptized" in English. It is a verb that describes the act of being immersed in water as a symbol of spiritual purification or initiation into a religious community. In Christian theology, baptism is considered a sacrament that marks the beginning of a person's spiritual journey and their acceptance into the church. The word εβαπτισθημεν is often used in the New Testament to describe the baptism of Jesus and his followers.
