Word: εβληθησαν

Etymology: The word εβληθησαν is a conjugated form of the Greek verb βάλλω (ballō), which means "to throw" or "to cast". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates that the verb is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Grammar: εβληθησαν is the third person plural, aorist passive indicative form of βάλλω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (which is not specified in this case) received the action of the verb.

Description: εβληθησαν can be translated as "they were thrown" or "they were cast". The context of the sentence would determine who or what was thrown or cast. For example, if the sentence was "Τα βιβλία εβλήθησαν στο πάτωμα" (Ta vivlia eblithisan sto patoma), it would mean "The books were thrown on the floor".
