Word: εβουλοντο

Etymology:
The word εβουλοντο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb βούλομαι (boulomai), which means "to will" or "to wish". The verb comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *bʰeh₂u- ("to be, exist, grow"), which is also the source of the English words "be" and "become".

Grammar:
εβουλοντο is the third person plural, imperfect middle/passive indicative form of βούλομαι. In Greek, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past.

Description:
εβουλοντο can be translated as "they were willing" or "they wished". The middle/passive voice suggests that the subject was both willing and being willed, or that their willingness was being acted upon. The imperfect tense indicates that this willingness was ongoing or repeated in the past.
