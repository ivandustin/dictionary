Word: εβαπτισθητε

Etymology: The word εβαπτισθητε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word βαπτίζω (baptizo), which means "to dip, immerse, or submerge." The prefix ε (e) in this word indicates that the action is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject is being baptized rather than performing the baptism.
