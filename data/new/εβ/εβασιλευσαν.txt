Word: εβασιλευσαν

Etymology: 
The word εβασιλευσαν (ebasileusan) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word βασιλεύω (basileuo), which means "to reign" or "to rule." The prefix ε- (e-) is a common Greek prefix that can indicate a variety of meanings, including "out," "away," or "completely." In this case, it likely emphasizes the completion or finality of the action of reigning or ruling.

Grammar:
εβασιλευσαν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb βασιλεύω (basileuo). The aorist tense in Greek typically indicates a past action that is viewed as a single event, rather than an ongoing or repeated action. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an implied third person plural) is performing the action of reigning or ruling.

Description:
εβασιλευσαν can be translated as "they reigned" or "they ruled" in English. The context in which the word appears would determine who the subject of the verb is and what they were reigning or ruling over. The aorist tense suggests that the action of reigning or ruling was completed at a specific point in the past.
