The word "εμμωρ" (emmor) is a Greek noun that means "bruise" or "contusion". 

Etymology: The word comes from the Greek verb "μωραίνω" (moraino), which means "to make foolish" or "to make stupid". The prefix "εμ-" (em-) is a variation of the prefix "εν-" (en-), which means "in" or "into". Therefore, "εμμωρ" (emmor) literally means "into foolishness", which may refer to the discoloration and swelling that occur after a bruise.

Grammar: "Εμμωρ" (emmor) is a masculine noun in the singular form. Its genitive form is "εμμωρίου" (emmoriou), and its plural form is "εμμώροι" (emmori).

Description: A bruise or contusion is a type of injury that occurs when small blood vessels under the skin are damaged, causing blood to leak into the surrounding tissue. This results in discoloration, swelling, and pain. Bruises can be caused by a variety of factors, such as trauma, falls, or medical conditions that affect blood clotting. While most bruises are not serious and will heal on their own, severe or frequent bruising may indicate an underlying health problem.
