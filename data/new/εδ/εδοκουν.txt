Word: εδοκουν

Etymology: The word εδοκουν (edokoun) is a conjugated form of the Greek verb δοκέω (dokéo), which means "to seem" or "to appear". It comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *dek-, which means "to take, accept".

Grammar: εδοκουν is the third person plural, imperfect indicative active form of the verb δοκέω. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, aspect, mood, voice, and person/number. The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, while the indicative mood expresses a statement of fact. The active voice means that the subject is performing the action.

Description: εδοκουν can be translated as "they seemed" or "they appeared" in English. It is used to describe a past action or state that was ongoing or repeated, and it implies that the speaker is not sure whether the action or state was actually true or not. For example, "Εδοκούν χαρούμενοι" (edokoun charoumenoi) means "They seemed happy".
