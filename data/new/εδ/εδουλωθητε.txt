Word: εδουλωθητε

Etymology: The word εδουλωθητε is derived from the Greek verb δουλόω (douloo), which means "to enslave" or "to make someone a slave". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Grammar: εδουλωθητε is a second person plural passive aorist form of the verb δουλόω (douloo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The passive voice indicates that the subject (you all) is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: εδουλωθητε means "you all were enslaved" or "you all have been made slaves". It is a form of the verb δουλόω (douloo), which is used to describe the act of enslaving or making someone a slave. The word can be used in a literal sense, to describe the act of physically enslaving someone, or in a metaphorical sense, to describe a situation in which someone is controlled or dominated by another person or entity.
