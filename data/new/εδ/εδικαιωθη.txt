Word: εδικαιωθη

Etymology:
The word εδικαιωθη is derived from the Greek verb δικαιόω (dikaióo), which means "to justify" or "to declare righteous". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Grammar:
εδικαιωθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb δικαιόω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon. Therefore, εδικαιωθη can be translated as "he/she/it was justified" or "he/she/it was declared righteous".

Description:
εδικαιωθη is a word that is often used in Christian theology to describe the process of justification, which is the act of God declaring a sinner to be righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. The word emphasizes that this declaration of righteousness is not something that the sinner can achieve on their own, but is a gift of God's grace. In everyday language, the word can also be used to describe a legal or moral justification for an action or decision.
