Word: εδικαιωθητε

Etymology: The word εδικαιωθητε comes from the Greek verb δικαιόω (dikaióo), which means "to justify" or "to declare righteous". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the passive voice, meaning "you have been justified" or "you have been declared righteous".

Grammar: εδικαιωθητε is a second person plural passive verb form in the aorist tense. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the action was done to the subject, rather than the subject doing the action.

Description: εδικαιωθητε is a word used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Romans (Romans 5:1). It is often translated as "you have been justified" or "you have been declared righteous" in English. The word is used to describe the act of God declaring a person righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. It is a central concept in Christian theology and is often referred to as "justification by faith".
