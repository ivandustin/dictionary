Grammar:
εδιδαχθητε is the second person plural aorist passive indicative form of the verb διδασκω (didasko). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the subject (in this case, "you all") received the action of the verb rather than performing it themselves.
