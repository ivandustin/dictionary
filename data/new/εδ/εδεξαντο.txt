Word: εδεξαντο

Etymology: εδεξαντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word δεχομαι (dekhomai), which means "to receive" or "to accept." The prefix ε- (e-) indicates that the action is in the past tense, and the suffix -αντο (-anto) indicates that the action was performed by a group of people.

Grammar: εδεξαντο is the third person plural form of the aorist tense in Greek. It is a passive voice verb, which means that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action rather than performing it. In this case, the subject is a group of people who are receiving or accepting something.

Description: εδεξαντο can be translated to English as "they received" or "they accepted." It is often used in the context of receiving or accepting something that has been offered or given. For example, "Εδεξαντο τα δώρα με χαρά" (Edexanto ta dora me hara) means "They received the gifts with joy."
