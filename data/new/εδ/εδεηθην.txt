The word "εδεηθην" (edethen) is a verb in the Greek language, which is in the aorist tense and passive voice. It is derived from the root word "δεή" (dei), which means "need" or "want". 

In terms of grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action rather than performing it. 

Therefore, "εδεηθην" can be translated to mean "I was needed" or "I was wanted". It is often used in a religious or spiritual context, such as in prayers or hymns, to express a sense of humility and dependence on a higher power.
