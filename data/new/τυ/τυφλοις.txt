τυφλοις (typhlois) is a Greek adjective in the dative plural form, meaning "blind" or "to the blind". It is derived from the Greek word τυφλός (typhlos), which means "blind". The word is commonly used in Greek mythology to describe characters who are blind, such as the prophet Tiresias. In modern Greek, it is used to describe people who are visually impaired. In grammar, τυφλοις is classified as a third declension adjective, which means it has different forms depending on the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies.
