Word: αββα

Etymology: The word αββα (abba) is a transliteration of the Aramaic word אַבָּא (abba), which means "father" or "daddy". It is a term of endearment and respect used by children to address their fathers.

Grammar: αββα is a noun in the Greek language. It is in the nominative case and is singular in number. It is also indeclinable, meaning that it does not change form to indicate gender, number, or case.

Description: αββα is a term that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospels of Mark and Paul's letter to the Romans. In Mark 14:36, Jesus uses the term to address God the Father in his prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane. In Romans 8:15, Paul uses the term to describe the relationship between believers and God, stating that they have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom they cry out, "Abba, Father!" The term has since become a common term of endearment and respect used by Christians to address God in prayer.
