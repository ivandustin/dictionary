Etymology: The word "συνεβουλευσαντο" comes from the Greek verb "συμβουλεύω" (sumbouleúo), which means "to advise" or "to counsel." The prefix "συν-" (syn-) indicates "together" or "with," and the suffix "-αντο" (-anto) is the third person plural aorist middle voice ending. Therefore, "συνεβουλευσαντο" can be translated as "they advised together" or "they counseled each other."

Grammar: "συνεβουλευσαντο" is a verb in the third person plural aorist middle voice form. In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express past actions without specifying their duration or completion. The middle voice indicates that the subject of the verb is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, it implies that the subject advised each other.

Description: "συνεβουλευσαντο" describes an action where multiple individuals advised or counseled each other. It suggests a collaborative decision-making process or a mutual exchange of advice.
