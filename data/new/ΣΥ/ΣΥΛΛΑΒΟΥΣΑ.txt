Grammar: "Συλλαβούσα" is the feminine form of the Greek adjective "συλλαβούσος" (syllaboúsos), which means "syllabic" or "having syllables." In Greek grammar, it is used to describe words or forms that are divided into syllables.

Description: "Συλλαβούσα" is a term used in linguistics to refer to the syllable that receives the primary stress in a word.
