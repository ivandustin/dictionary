Etymology: The word "συνκαλεσασθαι" (synkalesasthai) comes from the Greek roots "συν" (syn), meaning "together," and "καλεσασθαι" (kalesasthai), meaning "to call." 

Grammar: "Συνκαλεσασθαι" is a verb in the aorist middle infinitive form. It is derived from the verb "καλεω" (kaleo), meaning "to call," and the prefix "συν" (syn), which adds the meaning of "together." The middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.
