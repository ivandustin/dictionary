λαοδικιαι (laodikiai) is a Greek word that is derived from two words: λαός (laos) meaning "people" and δίκη (dike) meaning "justice". It is the plural form of λαοδίκεια (laodikeia) which means "judgments of the people". In ancient Greece, it referred to a system of justice where disputes were settled by a jury of citizens. In the New Testament, it is the name of a city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) that was known for its wealth and commerce. The city is mentioned in the Book of Revelation as one of the seven churches of Asia. In modern Greek, the word λαοδικιαι is used to refer to a legal judgment or decision. 

In terms of grammar, λαοδικιαι is a feminine noun in the nominative plural form. It is declined like other first declension nouns in Greek.
