Word: λατρεύω

Etymology:
The word λατρεύω (latreuo) comes from the Greek root word λατρεία (latreia), which means "worship" or "service." It is derived from the verb λατρεύειν (latreuein), which means "to serve" or "to worship."

Grammar:
λατρεύω is a Greek verb in the present tense, first person singular form. It is an active verb, meaning that the subject (in this case, "I") is performing the action of worship or service. The verb is also in the indicative mood, which indicates a statement of fact or reality.

Description:
λατρεύω is a word that is often used in a religious context to describe the act of worship or service to a deity. It can also be used more broadly to describe any act of service or devotion to a person or cause. In Greek culture, the concept of λατρεία was closely tied to the idea of sacrifice, and the word is often used in the context of offering sacrifices to the gods. Today, the word is still used in religious contexts, but it can also be used more broadly to describe any act of service or devotion.
