Word: λαληθείς

Etymology:
The word λαληθείς is derived from the Greek verb λαλέω (laleo), which means "to speak" or "to talk". The suffix -θείς (-theis) is a past participle ending, indicating that the word is in the past tense and passive voice. Therefore, λαληθείς means "having been spoken" or "having been talked about".

Grammar:
λαληθείς is a past participle in the passive voice, which means that it describes an action that was done to the subject of the sentence. In Greek, the verb "to be" is often omitted when using the passive voice, so the word can be translated as "spoken about" or "talked about". 

Description:
λαληθείς is a word that describes something that has been spoken or talked about in the past. It can be used to refer to a topic of conversation, a rumor, or a piece of information that has been shared. The word is often used in a passive sense, indicating that the subject of the sentence did not actively participate in the conversation or discussion.
