Word: λαμπρόν

Etymology:
The word λαμπρόν comes from the Greek word λαμπρός (lampros), which means "bright" or "shining". The suffix -όν (-on) is added to the end of the word to make it an adjective in the accusative case.

Grammar:
λαμπρόν is an adjective in the accusative case, which means it is used to describe a noun that is the direct object of a verb. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they are describing. Therefore, if the noun is masculine, singular, and in the accusative case, the adjective must also be masculine, singular, and in the accusative case.
