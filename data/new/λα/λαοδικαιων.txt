The word λαοδικαιων is a proper noun that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Colossians (Colossians 4:13). It refers to a city called Laodicea, which was located in the Lycus River valley in ancient Phrygia (modern-day Turkey). The people of Laodicea were known for their wealth and prosperity, but also for their lukewarm faith (Revelation 3:14-22).
