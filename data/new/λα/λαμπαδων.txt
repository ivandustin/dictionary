λαμπαδων (lampadōn) is a Greek word that means "torchbearer" or "torchlight". It is derived from the word λαμπάς (lampas), which means "torch" or "lamp", and the suffix -δων (-dōn), which is used to indicate a person who carries or bears something. In terms of grammar, λαμπαδων is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive λαμπαδῶν (lampadōn) or the accusative λαμπαδῶνα (lampadōna). In ancient Greece, torchbearers were often used in religious ceremonies and athletic competitions, and the word λαμπαδων was also used metaphorically to refer to someone who leads or guides others.
