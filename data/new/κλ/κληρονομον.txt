Word: κληρονομον

Etymology: 
The word κληρονομον (klēronomon) is derived from the Greek words κλῆρος (klēros) meaning "lot" or "inheritance" and νομός (nomos) meaning "law" or "custom". Therefore, κληρονομον can be translated as "one who receives an inheritance according to the law".

Grammar:
κληρονομον is a noun in the singular form. In Greek, nouns have gender, and κληρονομον is masculine. It is in the accusative case, which means it is the direct object of the sentence.

Description:
κληρονομον is a term used in Greek law to refer to an heir or inheritor. It is often used in the context of wills and inheritance. In ancient Greece, inheritance was an important part of society, and the laws surrounding it were complex. The term κληρονομον was used to refer to someone who received an inheritance according to the law, rather than through other means such as theft or fraud. Today, the term is still used in modern Greek to refer to an heir or inheritor.
