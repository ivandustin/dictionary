Word: κληθωμεν

Etymology: κληθωμεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call" or "to summon". The suffix -θωμεν (-thomen) is a passive ending that indicates the action is being done to the subject of the verb.

Grammar: κληθωμεν is a first-person plural passive subjunctive verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the passive ending -θωμεν to the stem κλη- (kle-), which is the first person plural present subjunctive form of καλέω (kaleo). The subjunctive mood is used to express doubt, uncertainty, or hypothetical situations.

Description: κληθωμεν means "let us be called" or "may we be summoned" in English. It is often used in religious or formal contexts, such as in prayers or official documents. The passive voice indicates that the subject is receiving the action of the verb, rather than performing it. In this case, the subject is the speaker and their companions, who are asking to be called or summoned.
