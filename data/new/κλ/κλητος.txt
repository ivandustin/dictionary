Word: κλητός

Etymology:
The word κλητός (klitos) is derived from the Greek verb καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call." The suffix -τός (-tos) is added to the verb stem to form an adjective that means "called" or "invited."

Grammar:
In Greek, κλητός is an adjective that agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if the noun is masculine, singular, and in the nominative case, the adjective would be κλητός. If the noun is feminine, plural, and in the accusative case, the adjective would be κλητές.

Description:
The word κλητός can be used to describe someone who has been called or invited to a particular event or gathering. It can also be used to describe something that has been designated or named, such as a title or a position. In Christian theology, the term κλητός is used to refer to those who have been called by God to serve in a particular ministry or vocation.
