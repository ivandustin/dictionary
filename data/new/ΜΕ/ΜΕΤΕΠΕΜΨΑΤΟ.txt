μετεπεμψάτο (metepempsáto) is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix μετα- (meta-), meaning "after" or "beyond," and the verb επεμψα (epempsa), meaning "I sent." 

In terms of grammar, μετεπεμψάτο is the third person singular, aorist middle voice form of the verb. The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a whole, without any specific duration. The middle voice indicates that the subject of the verb is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

The verb μετεπεμψάτο is used to express the idea of someone sending or dispatching someone or something after someone else. It can also imply the idea of sending someone back or returning them to a previous location.
