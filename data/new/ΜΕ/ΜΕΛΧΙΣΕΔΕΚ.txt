μελχισεδέκ (melchisedek) is a Greek word that is transliterated from the Hebrew name מַלְכִּי־צֶדֶק (Malki-Tzedek). In the Hebrew Bible, Melchizedek is a mysterious figure who appears in the Book of Genesis. He is described as the king of Salem (which is believed to be the ancient name for Jerusalem) and a priest of God Most High. Melchizedek is also mentioned in the New Testament, particularly in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he is portrayed as a type of Christ.

Etymology:
The name Melchizedek is composed of two Hebrew words: מֶלֶךְ (melekh), meaning "king," and צֶדֶק (tzedek), meaning "righteousness" or "justice." Therefore, the name can be translated as "king of righteousness" or "my king is righteousness."

Grammar:
In Greek, the word μελχισεδέκ (melchisedek) is a transliteration of the Hebrew name. It does not have a specific grammatical meaning in Greek.

Description:
Melchizedek is a significant figure in biblical and religious studies. He is often seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, as both are described as kings and priests. Melchizedek's appearance in the Bible is brief, but his role as a priest and his association with Jerusalem have led to various interpretations and speculations about his identity and significance.
