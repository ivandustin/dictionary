μετανοησατε (metanoisate) is a Greek verb that means "to repent" or "to regret." It is derived from the combination of the prefix μετα- (meta-), meaning "after" or "beyond," and the verb νοιάζομαι (noiazomai), meaning "to care" or "to be concerned."

In Greek grammar, it belongs to the aorist tense, which is used to express a completed action in the past.
