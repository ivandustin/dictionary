μετανόησης (metanoia) is a Greek word that has its roots in the combination of two words: "meta" meaning "change" and "noia" meaning "mind" or "thinking." In Greek, it is often used to describe the act of changing one's mind or thinking, particularly in the context of repentance or remorse for past actions. In Christian theology, metanoia is often associated with a spiritual transformation or conversion. In grammar, metanoia is a noun that is typically used to refer to a change in thought or perspective.
