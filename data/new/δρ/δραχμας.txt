Description:
δραχμας is the ancient Greek currency that was used in various city-states of Greece, including Athens. It was a silver coin that was widely used for trade and commerce. The value of the drachma varied over time and depended on the weight and purity of the silver used to mint the coins. In ancient times, the drachma was also used as a unit of weight, with one drachma being equivalent to six obols. The drachma remained in use until the introduction of the euro in Greece in 2002.
