The word "ηγεν" (pronounced "ee-ghen") is a Greek adjective that means "native" or "indigenous". 

Etymology: The word comes from the Greek root "ἡγε-" (hēge-), which means "to lead" or "to guide". The suffix "-ν" (-n) is a common ending for adjectives in Greek.

Grammar: "Ηγεν" is a masculine singular adjective in the nominative case. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify.

Description: The word "ηγεν" is often used to describe people or things that are native to a particular place or region. For example, one might say "οι ηγενείς κάτοικοι της Κρήτης" (oi egheneis katoikoi tis Kritis) to refer to the native inhabitants of Crete. The word can also be used in a more general sense to describe something that is inherent or innate, such as "η ηγενής ικανότητα του ανθρώπου να σκέφτεται" (i eghenis ikanotita tou anthropou na skeftetai), which means "the inherent ability of humans to think".
