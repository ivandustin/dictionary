Etymology: The word "υπηντησεν" comes from the Greek verb "υπαντάω" (ipantáo), which means "to meet" or "to encounter". It is derived from the combination of the preposition "υπό" (ypo), meaning "under" or "below", and the verb "ανταποκρίνομαι" (antapokrínomai), meaning "to respond" or "to answer".

Grammar: "υπηντησεν" is the third person singular form of the aorist tense of the verb "υπαντάω" (ipantáo). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a completed action in the past. The third person singular form indicates that the subject of the verb is a singular third person (he, she, or it).
