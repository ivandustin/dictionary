The word "πατροπαραδοτου" is a Greek adjective that is derived from the combination of two words: "πατροπαράδοτος" (patroparadotos) and "πατροπαραδοτικός" (patroparadotikos). 

The first part of the word, "πατρο-" (patro-), means "father" in Greek. The second part, "-παραδοτου" (-paradotou), is derived from the Greek verb "παραδίδωμι" (paradidomi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." 

Therefore, "πατροπαραδοτου" can be translated as "handed down from father to son" or "inherited from one's father." It is often used to describe traditions, customs, or beliefs that have been passed down from generation to generation within a family or community. 

In terms of grammar, "πατροπαραδοτου" is an adjective that agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if it is used to describe a masculine singular noun, it would be "πατροπαραδοτος" (patroparadotos).
