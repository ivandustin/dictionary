The word "παρακαλουμεν" is a Greek verb in the present tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. It is the first person plural form of the verb "παρακαλέω" (parakaleo), which means "to call alongside," "to encourage," "to exhort," or "to comfort." 

The word is composed of two parts: "παρά" (para), which means "beside" or "alongside," and "καλέω" (kaleo), which means "to call." Therefore, "παρακαλέω" literally means "to call someone alongside oneself," implying a sense of comfort and support.

In its passive form, "παρακαλουμεν" means "we are being encouraged" or "we are being comforted." The word can be used in various contexts, such as in religious or spiritual settings, to express the idea of being comforted or encouraged by a higher power or community. It can also be used in everyday conversation to express gratitude or appreciation for someone's support or encouragement.
