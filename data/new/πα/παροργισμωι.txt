I'm sorry, but the word "παροργισμωι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "παροργισμός" (parorgismos), which means provocation or irritation. 

Etymology: The word "παροργισμός" comes from the Greek prefix "παρά" (para), meaning "beside" or "beyond," and the verb "οργίζω" (orgizo), meaning "to provoke" or "to anger." 

Grammar: "Παροργισμός" is a masculine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "Παροργισμός" refers to the act of provoking or irritating someone, often intentionally. It can also refer to the feeling of anger or irritation that results from being provoked.
