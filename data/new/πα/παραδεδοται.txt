Etymology:
The word παραδεδοται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παραδίδωμι (paradidomi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." The word is a perfect passive indicative form of the verb, which means that it describes an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Grammar:
παραδεδοται is a third-person singular form of the verb παραδίδωμι in the perfect passive indicative tense. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, mood, and person. The perfect tense describes an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action. The indicative mood is used to make a statement or ask a question.

Description:

The word is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the act of delivering someone or something into the hands of another. For example, in Matthew 26:15, the word is used to describe Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus: "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" In Romans 4:25, the word is used to describe Jesus' death and resurrection: "He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification."
