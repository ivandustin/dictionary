Word: παρεδιδουν

Etymology: The word παρεδιδουν is a conjugated form of the Greek verb παραδίδωμι (paradídōmi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver". It is derived from the prefix παρά (pará), meaning "beside" or "near", and the verb δίδωμι (dídōmi), meaning "to give".

Grammar: παρεδιδουν is the third person plural, imperfect indicative active form of the verb παραδίδωμι. In this form, it indicates an ongoing action in the past, where the subject (who is not specified in this case) was handing over or delivering something.

Description: παρεδιδουν is a Greek verb that describes an action of delivering or handing over something. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine what was being handed over or who was doing the handing over. The imperfect tense suggests that the action was ongoing in the past, but it does not provide any information about when the action started or ended.
