Description:
παρεπιδημοι is a term used in ancient Greek literature to refer to foreigners who lived in a city or country but were not citizens. They were often merchants, traders, or artisans who came from other parts of Greece or from other countries. In some cases, they were allowed to live and work in the city, but they did not have the same rights and privileges as citizens. The term is used in the New Testament to refer to Christians who were living in a foreign land, but it is also used in other ancient Greek texts to describe non-Christian foreigners.
