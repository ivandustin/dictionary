Word: παραφερεσθε

Etymology:
The word παραφερεσθε comes from the Greek verb παραφέρω (parapherō), which means "to carry along, to bring forward, to offer, to present." It is derived from the prefix παρά (para), meaning "beside" or "alongside," and the verb φέρω (pherō), meaning "to carry."

Grammar:
παραφερεσθε is a second person plural present middle/passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εσθε (-esthe) to the present stem παραφερ- (parapher-). The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, or that the action is being done to or for the subject.

Description:
παραφερεσθε is a command that can be translated as "carry along yourselves" or "bring forward yourselves." It is often used in a figurative sense, meaning "to advance, to progress, to improve oneself." The middle/passive voice suggests that the action is being done for the benefit of the subject, rather than for someone else. The word can be found in the New Testament, in the book of Hebrews 13:9.
