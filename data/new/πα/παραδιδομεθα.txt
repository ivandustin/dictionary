Word: παραδιδομεθα

Etymology:
The word παραδιδομεθα is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παραδίδωμι (paradidomi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." The suffix -μεθα (-metha) indicates that the verb is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Grammar:
παραδιδομεθα is a first-person plural present passive indicative verb in Greek. This means that the subject of the verb is "we" and that the action is being done to us. The present tense indicates that the action is happening now, and the indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description:
παραδιδομεθα can be translated to English as "we are being handed over" or "we are being delivered." This verb is often used in the context of betrayal or surrender, as it implies that the subject is being given up to someone else. It can also be used in a more neutral sense to indicate that something is being transferred or passed on.
