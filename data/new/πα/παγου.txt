I'm sorry, but the word "παγου" is not a valid Greek word. It is possible that you meant to type "πάγου", which is the genitive singular form of the Greek word "πάγος" (págos), meaning "iceberg" or "ice floe". 

Etymology: The word "πάγος" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *pek̑u-, meaning "to be stiff" or "to congeal". It is related to the English word "peak" and the Latin word "pax" (meaning "peace", as in a frozen or motionless state).

Grammar: "πάγου" is the genitive singular form of the noun "πάγος". In Greek, the genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and is often translated into English as "of" or "'s". For example, "το πάγος του Βόρειου Πόλου" (to págos tou Vóreiou Pólou) means "the iceberg of the North Pole".

Description: "πάγος" is a masculine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "πάγοι" (págoi). It is a common word in Greek, especially in the context of polar regions and cold climates. In modern Greek, it is also used metaphorically to describe a person who is emotionally cold or distant.
