Word: παρεχειν

Etymology: παρεχειν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix παρα- (para-), which means "beside" or "near", and the verb ἔχειν (echein), which means "to have" or "to hold". Therefore, παρεχειν can be translated as "to have beside" or "to hold near".

Grammar: παρεχειν is an active present infinitive verb in Greek. It belongs to the first conjugation of verbs, which means that its stem is formed by removing the ending -ειν (ein) from the present indicative active form of the verb. In this case, the stem is παρεχ- (parech-).
