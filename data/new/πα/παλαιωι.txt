I'm sorry, but the word "παλαιωι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling or a non-standard variation of the word "παλαιός" (palaiós), which means "old" or "ancient". 

Etymology: The word "παλαιός" comes from the Greek root "παλαιό-" (palaió-), which means "old" or "ancient". 

Grammar: "παλαιός" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. It can also be declined to match the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. 

Description: "παλαιός" is a common word in Greek, used to describe anything that is old or ancient. It can be used to describe people, objects, or ideas. For example, "Ο παλαιός καθηγητής μου" (O palaiós kathigítis mou) means "My old professor", while "Η παλαιά αρχιτεκτονική της πόλης" (I palaiá architektonikí tis pólis) means "The ancient architecture of the city".
