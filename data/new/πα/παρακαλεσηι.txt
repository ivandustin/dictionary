I'm sorry, but the word "παρακαλεσηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "παράκληση" (paraklisi), which means "encouragement" or "consolation". 

Etymology: The word "παράκληση" comes from the Greek verb "παρακαλώ" (parakalo), which means "to call to one's side", "to invite", or "to urge". 

Grammar: "Παράκληση" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "Παράκληση" is a word that is often used in religious contexts, particularly in the Orthodox Christian Church, where it refers to a prayer service for the dead. It can also be used more generally to refer to any act of encouragement or comfort.
