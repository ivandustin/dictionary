Word: πατριάρχης

Etymology:
The word πατριάρχης (patriarches) comes from the Greek words πατήρ (pater), meaning "father," and ἄρχων (archon), meaning "ruler" or "leader." The term originally referred to the male head of a family or tribe, but later came to be used to describe the highest-ranking bishop in certain Christian churches.

Grammar:
In Greek, πατριάρχης is a masculine noun in the nominative case. Its plural form is πατριάρχαι (patriarchai). The word is declined like other Greek nouns of the first declension, with the stem πατριαρχ- and various endings depending on the case and number.

Description:
πατριάρχης is a term used in various Christian churches to refer to the highest-ranking bishop or leader. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the patriarch is the bishop of one of the five ancient sees (Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, and Moscow) and is considered to be the first among equals among the bishops. In the Roman Catholic Church, the patriarchate is an honorary title given to certain archbishops, while in the Anglican Communion, the term is used to refer to the bishop of Jerusalem. Outside of Christianity, the term patriarch can also be used more broadly to refer to a male head of a family or tribe.
