Word: παρεκυψεν

Etymology: The word παρεκυψεν comes from the Greek verb παρακύπτω (parakypto), which means "to bend over, stoop down, or peer closely." It is formed from the prefix παρα- (para-), meaning "beside" or "near," and the verb κύπτω (kypto), meaning "to bend or stoop."

Grammar: παρεκυψεν is the aorist tense, third person singular form of the verb παρακύπτω (parakypto). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The third person singular form indicates that the subject of the verb is a single person or thing, and that the action was performed by that person or thing.

Description: παρεκυψεν describes the action of someone bending over or stooping down to look closely at something. It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is paying close attention to something or investigating it thoroughly. The word is often used in the context of spying or surveillance, as in the phrase "to spy on" or "to keep watch over."
