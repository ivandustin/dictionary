Word: παρατυγχάνοντας

Etymology: The word παρατυγχάνοντας comes from the Greek prefix παρα- (para-), meaning "beside" or "near," and the verb τυγχάνω (tygchano), meaning "to happen" or "to chance upon." The suffix -οντας (-ontas) indicates the present participle form of the verb.

Grammar: παρατυγχάνοντας is a present participle in the active voice, which means it describes an ongoing action that is currently happening. It is formed by adding the suffix -οντας to the stem of the verb τυγχάνω. The word is masculine, singular, and nominative, which means it is the subject of the sentence.
