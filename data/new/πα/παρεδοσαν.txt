Word: παρεδοσαν

Etymology:
The word παρεδοσαν (paredosan) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παραδίδωμι (paradidomi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." It is a compound word made up of the prefix παρα- (para-), which means "beside" or "alongside," and the verb δίδωμι (didomi), which means "to give."

Grammar:
παρεδοσαν is the third person plural aorist indicative active form of the verb παραδίδωμι (paradidomi). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The indicative mood is used to make a statement or ask a question. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description:
παρεδοσαν is often translated as "they handed over" or "they delivered." It is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the actions of those who betrayed Jesus, such as Judas Iscariot and the Jewish leaders who handed him over to the Roman authorities for crucifixion. The word can also be used more generally to describe the act of delivering or handing something over to someone else.
