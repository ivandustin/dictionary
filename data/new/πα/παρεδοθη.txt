Word: παρεδοθη

Etymology:
The word παρεδοθη (paredothi) is a Greek word that comes from the verb παραδίδωμι (paradidomi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." This verb is composed of two parts: παρά (para), which means "beside" or "near," and δίδωμι (didomi), which means "to give."

Grammar:
παρεδοθη is the aorist passive indicative form of the verb παραδίδωμι (paradidomi). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
παρεδοθη is a Greek word that means "was handed over" or "was delivered." It is often used in the New Testament to describe the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot, as in Matthew 26:45: "Then he came to the disciples and said to them, 'Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.'" The word can also be used more generally to describe the act of handing something over or delivering it to someone else.
