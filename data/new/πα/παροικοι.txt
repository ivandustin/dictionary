Description:
παροικοι is a term used in ancient Greece to refer to non-citizens who lived in a city-state but were not granted the same rights and privileges as citizens. They were often foreigners or immigrants who settled in a city-state for various reasons, such as trade or work. They were required to pay taxes and follow the laws of the city-state, but they were not allowed to participate in the political process or hold public office. Despite their lack of rights, παροικοι played an important role in the economy and culture of ancient Greece.
