Word: παροικος

Etymology:
The word παροικος (paroikos) is derived from the Greek words παρά (para) meaning "beside" or "near" and οἶκος (oikos) meaning "house" or "dwelling". The word originally referred to a person who lived near or beside someone else's house, but later came to refer to a resident alien or a sojourner.

Grammar:
In Greek, παροικος is a masculine noun in the nominative case. Its plural form is παροικοι (paroikoi). It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive case παροικου (paroikou) and the accusative case παροικον (paroikon).

Description:
παροικος is a term used in ancient Greek to describe a resident alien or a sojourner. It was often used to refer to non-Greek people who lived in Greek cities or territories. These individuals were not citizens and did not have the same rights and privileges as Greek citizens. They were often subject to special taxes and restrictions on their activities. Despite these limitations, many paroikoi played important roles in Greek society, serving as merchants, artisans, and even soldiers.
