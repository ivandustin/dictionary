Description:
παιδίσκης (paidiskes) was a term used in ancient Greece to refer to young girls who were employed as servants in households. They were usually from poor families and were sold into slavery. They performed various tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and taking care of children. They were considered the lowest class of slaves and were often mistreated by their owners. However, some were able to gain their freedom and even become wealthy through their work. The term is no longer used in modern Greek and has been replaced by the word υπηρέτρια (yperetria), which means "maid" or "servant".
