Word: παρελθων

Etymology:
The word παρελθων comes from the Greek verb παρέρχομαι (parerchomai), which means "to pass by" or "to go past". The word is formed from the prefix παρα- (para-), which means "beside" or "alongside", and the verb ἔρχομαι (erchomai), which means "to come" or "to go".

Grammar:
παρελθων is the aorist participle of the verb παρέρχομαι (parerchomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The participle form of a verb is used to describe a person or thing that is performing the action of the verb, or that is affected by the action of the verb.

Description:
παρελθων can be translated as "having passed by" or "having gone past". It is often used in Greek literature to describe something that has already happened, or to refer to a person or thing that has already passed by or gone past. For example, in the sentence "ὁ παρελθὼν χρόνος" (ho parelthon chronos), which means "the time that has passed", παρελθων is used to describe the time that has already gone by.
