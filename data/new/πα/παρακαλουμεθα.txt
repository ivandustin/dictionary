Word: παρακαλουμεθα

Etymology:
The word παρακαλουμεθα (parakaloumetha) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παρακαλέω (parakaleo), which means "to call to one's side" or "to encourage." The suffix -ουμεθα (-oumetha) indicates that the verb is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Grammar:
παρακαλουμεθα is a first-person plural passive verb in the present tense. It is often translated as "we are being encouraged" or "we are being called to one's side." The verb is conjugated from the root word παρακαλέω (parakaleo), which is a regular first-conjugation verb in Greek.
