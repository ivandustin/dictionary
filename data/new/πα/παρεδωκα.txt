Word: παρεδωκα

Etymology:
The word παρεδωκα (paredoka) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word διδωμι (didomi), which means "to give." The prefix παρα (para) means "beside" or "alongside," so the word παρεδωκα can be translated as "I gave alongside" or "I handed over."

Grammar:
παρεδωκα is a first-person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb παραδιδωμι (paradidomi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject (in this case, "I") performed the action.

Description:
παρεδωκα is a specific form of the verb παραδιδωμι (paradidomi), which is used frequently in the New Testament of the Bible. In particular, this form appears in Matthew 26:48, where Judas Iscariot says to Jesus, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kisses him, after which the soldiers with Judas "laid hands on Jesus and arrested him." Judas is often referred to as the one who "handed over" or "betrayed" Jesus, so this form of the verb is significant in that context.
