Description: παροικίαι refers to the communities of resident foreigners in ancient Greek cities. These communities were made up of people who were not citizens of the city but who lived there permanently or for an extended period of time. They were often merchants, artisans, or laborers who had come to the city for economic opportunities. The παροικίαι had their own laws and customs and were subject to different taxes and obligations than the citizens of the city. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to any group of resident foreigners in a particular place or time.
