Word: παρακαλεισθε

Etymology: The word παρακαλεισθε comes from the Greek verb παρακαλέω (parakaleo), which means "to call to one's side" or "to encourage." It is formed from the prefix παρα- (para-), which means "beside" or "alongside," and the verb καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call."

Grammar: παρακαλεισθε is a second person plural present passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εισθε (-eisthe) to the stem παρακαλε- (parakale-). The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action. The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests.

Description: παρακαλεισθε is a command or request to be encouraged or comforted. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context, such as in the Bible, where it is translated as "be comforted" or "be encouraged." In modern Greek, it can also be used in a more general sense to mean "please" or "I ask of you."
