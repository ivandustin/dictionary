Word: παρεστηκεν

Etymology:
The word παρεστηκεν (parestēken) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παρίστημι (paristēmi), which means "to stand beside" or "to present oneself." The prefix παρα- (para-) means "beside" or "near," and the suffix -στηκεν (-stēken) is the perfect tense form of the verb.

Grammar:
παρεστηκεν is a third-person singular perfect active indicative verb in Greek. The perfect tense indicates a completed action in the past with ongoing results in the present. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:

The verb is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe someone appearing before a judge or authority figure. It can also be used more generally to describe someone standing or presenting themselves in a particular place or situation.
