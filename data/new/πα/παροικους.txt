Description:
παροικους refers to a group of resident foreigners or sojourners. In ancient Greece, there were many people who lived in a city-state but were not citizens. These people were known as πάροικοι (paroikoi) and were often merchants, artisans, or laborers who had come from other parts of Greece or from other countries.

The word παροικους is used in the New Testament of the Bible to refer to Christians who were living in a foreign land.
