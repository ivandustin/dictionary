Sorry, I cannot define the word "παρασκευην" as it is not a valid Greek word. The correct spelling is "Παρασκευήν" which means "Friday" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "Παρασκευήν" comes from the Greek word "παρασκευάζω" which means "to prepare". 

Grammar: Παρασκευήν is a feminine noun in the accusative case. 

Description: Παρασκευήν is the sixth day of the week in the Greek calendar and is considered a day of preparation for the weekend. It is also an important day in the Christian religion as it is the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
