Word: παρεβιάσαντο

Etymology:
The word παρεβιάσαντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word βιάζομαι (biázomai), which means "to use force" or "to be violent." The prefix παρε- (pare-) means "beyond" or "beside," so the word παρεβιάσαντο can be translated as "they were forced beyond" or "they were violently taken."

Grammar:
παρεβιάσαντο is the third person plural aorist passive indicative form of the verb παραβιάζω (paraviázo), which means "to violate" or "to transgress." In this form, the verb indicates that the action was done to the subject (they were forced) rather than by the subject.
