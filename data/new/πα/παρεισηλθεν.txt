Word: παρεισηλθεν

Etymology:
The word παρεισηλθεν is a Greek word that is derived from the combination of three words: παρά (para) meaning "beside", εἰσέρχομαι (eiserchomai) meaning "to enter", and the past tense suffix -εν (-en). Therefore, the word παρεισηλθεν means "he/she/it entered beside".

Grammar:
παρεισηλθεν is a verb in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. It is also in the third person singular form, which means that it refers to a single subject (he/she/it). The verb is composed of the prefix παρά (para) and the verb εἰσέρχομαι (eiserchomai), which means "to enter". The prefix παρά (para) adds the meaning of "beside" or "alongside" to the verb, indicating that the subject entered beside or alongside something or someone.
