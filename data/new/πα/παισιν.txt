The word "παισιν" (paisin) is a Greek noun in the dative plural form, which means "to children" or "for children". It is derived from the Greek word "παῖς" (pais), which means "child" or "boy". In Greek grammar, it is classified as a second declension noun, which means that its endings change depending on its grammatical case. 

Etymologically, the word "παῖς" (pais) is believed to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European root *peu-, which means "to cut, strike, or stamp". This root is also the source of other words in Greek, such as "πέλεκυς" (pelekys) meaning "axe" and "πούς" (pous) meaning "foot".

In terms of usage, "παισιν" (paisin) is often used in Greek literature and poetry to refer to children or young people. It can also be used in a more general sense to refer to a group of people who are considered to be innocent or vulnerable.
