Word: παραλαβειν

Etymology:
The word παραλαβειν comes from the Greek verb παραλαμβάνω (paralambanō), which is a compound of the preposition παρά (para), meaning "beside" or "alongside," and the verb λαμβάνω (lambanō), meaning "to take" or "to receive." The prefix παρά in this context indicates the idea of receiving something from someone else.

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition.
