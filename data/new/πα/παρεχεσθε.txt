Word: παρεχεσθε

Etymology: The word παρεχεσθε comes from the Greek verb παρέχω (parechō), which means "to provide" or "to furnish". It is derived from the prefix παρά (para), meaning "beside" or "alongside", and the verb ἔχω (echō), meaning "to have" or "to hold".

Grammar: παρεχεσθε is a second person plural present passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εσθε (-esthe) to the present stem παρεχ- (parech-), which is derived from the verb παρέχω (parechō). The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: παρεχεσθε is a command or instruction in Greek, telling a group of people to "be provided" or "be furnished". It is often used in a figurative sense, meaning to "supply" or "give" something to someone. In English, it could be translated as "provide yourselves" or "furnish yourselves".
