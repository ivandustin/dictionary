I'm sorry, but the word "παραδοθεισηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "παραδοθείσα" (paradotheisa), which is the feminine form of the past participle of the verb "παραδίδω" (paradido), meaning "to deliver, to hand over". 

Etymology: The word "παραδίδω" comes from the prefix "παρά" (para), meaning "beside, alongside", and the verb "δίδωμι" (didomi), meaning "to give". 

Grammar: "παραδοθείσα" is the feminine form of the past participle, which agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, "η παραδοθείσα εργασία" (i paraditheisa ergasia) means "the delivered work" (feminine singular).

Description: The word "παραδοθείσα" is commonly used in legal and bureaucratic contexts to refer to documents, goods, or services that have been delivered or handed over to someone. It can also be used in a figurative sense to mean "surrendered" or "yielded".
