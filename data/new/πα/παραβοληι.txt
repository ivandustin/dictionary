Etymology: The word "παραβολή" comes from the Greek verb "παραβάλλω" (paraballō), which means "to compare" or "to put side by side". 

Grammar: "παραβολή" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "παραβολές" (parabolēs). 

Description: In the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus often used parables to teach moral and spiritual lessons.
