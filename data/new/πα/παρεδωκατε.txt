Word: παρεδωκατε

Etymology:
The word παρεδωκατε (paredōkate) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παραδίδωμι (paradidōmi), which means "to hand over" or "to deliver." It is a compound word made up of the prefix παρα- (para-), which means "beside" or "alongside," and the verb δίδωμι (didōmi), which means "to give."

Grammar:
παρεδωκατε is the second person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb παραδίδωμι (paradidōmi). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
παρεδωκατε can be translated to English as "you handed over" or "you delivered." It is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the act of Judas Iscariot betraying Jesus to the authorities (Matthew 26:46, Mark 14:42, Luke 22:48, John 18:2). The word can also be used more generally to describe the act of handing something over or delivering something to someone else.
