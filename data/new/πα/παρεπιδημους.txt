These individuals were not citizens of the place where they resided, but they were allowed to live and work there. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe Christians who were living in a foreign land, but who were not citizens of that land. The term is also used in modern Greek to refer to immigrants or expatriates who are living in a foreign country.
