Word: παρεκληθη

Etymology:
The word παρεκληθη (pareklēthē) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παράκλησις (paraklēsis), which means "comfort" or "encouragement." The verb form παρεκληθη is the aorist passive indicative form of the verb παρακαλέω (parakaleō), which means "to call to one's side," "to exhort," or "to comfort."

Grammar:
παρεκληθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb παρακαλέω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the person who was comforted or encouraged) is the recipient of the action, rather than the one performing the action.

Description:
The word παρεκληθη can be translated as "was comforted" or "was encouraged." It implies that someone provided comfort or encouragement to the person who is the subject of the verb. The context in which the word is used would determine who provided the comfort or encouragement and why it was needed.
