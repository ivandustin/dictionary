Word: παρεβιάσατο

Etymology:
The word παρεβιάσατο (parebiasato) is a conjugated form of the Greek verb παραβιάζομαι (paraviázomai), which comes from the prefix παρά (pará), meaning "beside" or "beyond," and the verb βιάζομαι (viázomai), meaning "to use force" or "to violate." Therefore, παραβιάζομαι means "to use force against" or "to violate."

Grammar:

In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, aspect, voice, mood, and person/number. The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is completed, while the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.
