The word "οριοις" (oriois) is a Greek noun in the dative plural form. It comes from the root word "οριον" (orion), which means "boundary" or "limit". In Greek grammar, the dative case is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb or the object of certain prepositions.

Therefore, "οριοις" can be translated as "to the boundaries" or "to the limits" depending on the context. It is often used in a figurative sense to refer to the limits or boundaries of something abstract, such as knowledge, understanding, or patience.
