Etymology:
The word ατεκνος comes from the Greek roots α- (a-), meaning "not," and τεκνον (teknon), meaning "child." Therefore, ατεκνος means "childless" or "without children."

Grammar:
ατεκνος is an adjective in Greek, and it can be used to describe a person or a thing that is without children. It is declined like other first-declension adjectives in Greek.

Description:
ατεκνος is a word that describes someone who does not have any children. It can be used to describe both men and women, and it is often used in legal or medical contexts. In ancient Greece, being childless was considered a great misfortune, as having children was seen as a way to ensure one's legacy and secure one's place in society. However, in modern times, being childless is a personal choice for many people, and it is no longer seen as a social stigma.
