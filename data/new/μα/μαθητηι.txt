I'm sorry, but the word "μαθητηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It may be a misspelling of the word "μαθητής" (mathitis), which means "student" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "μαθητής" comes from the ancient Greek verb "μανθάνω" (manthano), which means "to learn". 

Grammar: "Μαθητής" is a masculine noun in the singular form. In the plural form, it becomes "μαθητές" (mathites). 

Description: "Μαθητής" is a common word in the Greek language, used to refer to a student of any age or level of education. It can also be used in a broader sense to refer to a disciple or follower of a particular teacher or philosophy.
