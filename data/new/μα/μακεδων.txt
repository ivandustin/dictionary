The word "μακεδων" (Makedon) is a Greek noun that refers to a person from the ancient region of Macedonia, which is now part of Greece, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. The etymology of the word is uncertain, but it is believed to have originated from the ancient Greek word "μακεδνός" (Makednos), which was the name of a legendary ancestor of the Macedonian people. 

In terms of grammar, "μακεδων" is a masculine noun in the singular form. It belongs to the second declension in Greek, which means that its endings change depending on its grammatical case. For example, in the nominative case (subject), it is "μακεδων," but in the genitive case (possessive), it is "μακεδόνος" (Makedonos).

In ancient Greek literature, "μακεδων" was often used to refer to the Macedonian soldiers who served in the armies of Alexander the Great. Today, the word is still used in modern Greek to refer to people from the region of Macedonia.
