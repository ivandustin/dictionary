Word: μακαρισμός

Etymology: The word μακαρισμός comes from the Greek word μακάριος (makarios), which means "blessed" or "happy". The suffix -ισμός (-ismos) is added to the end of the word to form a noun, indicating the state or quality of being blessed or happy.

Grammar: μακαρισμός is a masculine noun in Greek, and its plural form is μακαρισμοί (makarismoi). It is often used in the singular form, however, to refer to a specific instance of blessedness or happiness.

Description: μακαρισμός is a term used in Greek Orthodox theology to refer to the state of blessedness or happiness that is experienced by the saints in heaven. It is also used more broadly to refer to any state of happiness or contentment, whether spiritual or material. In literature, the term is often used to describe a state of bliss or ecstasy, and is sometimes associated with the concept of transcendence.
