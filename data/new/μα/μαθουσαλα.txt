μαθουσαλα (mathousala) is a Greek word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible. It is the name of a biblical figure who is said to have lived for 969 years. The etymology of the word is uncertain, but it is believed to be derived from the Hebrew name Methuselah, which means "man of the dart" or "man of the missile". In Greek, the word is spelled μαθουσαλά, with an accent on the last syllable. 

In terms of grammar, μαθουσαλα is a proper noun and is therefore not subject to the usual rules of Greek grammar. 

In the Bible, Methuselah is described as the son of Enoch and the grandfather of Noah. He is said to have lived longer than any other person in history, dying at the age of 969. The story of Methuselah is often used as an example of the long lifespans of people in the early days of humanity.
