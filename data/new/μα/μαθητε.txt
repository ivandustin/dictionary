Sorry, I cannot define the word "μαθητε" as it is not a valid Greek word. It might be a misspelling of the Greek word "μαθητής" (mathitis) which means "student". 

Etymology: The word "μαθητής" comes from the Greek verb "μανθάνω" (manthano) which means "to learn".

Grammar: "μαθητής" is a masculine noun in the singular form. In the plural form, it becomes "μαθητές" (mathites).

Description: "μαθητής" refers to a person who is learning or studying a subject, typically in a school or educational institution. It can also refer to a disciple or follower of a teacher or mentor.
