The word μαγων (magon) is a Greek noun that refers to a sorcerer or magician. It is derived from the verb μάγευω (mageuo), which means to practice magic or sorcery. In terms of grammar, μαγων is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive μάγου (magou) or the accusative μάγον (magon). In ancient Greek literature, magoi were often associated with foreign cultures and were sometimes depicted as wise men or advisors. However, in later Christian texts, the term took on a negative connotation and was associated with demonic practices.
