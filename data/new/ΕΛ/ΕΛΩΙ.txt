Etymology: The word "ελωι" (elōi) comes from the Greek language. It is derived from the Aramaic phrase "אֵלִי אֵלִי לָמָה שְׁבַקְתָּנִי" (Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani), which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This phrase is found in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark.

Grammar: "Ελωι" is a transliteration of the Aramaic phrase, so it does not have a specific grammatical structure in Greek. However, it is often used as an interjection or exclamation expressing distress, anguish, or a cry for help.

Description: "Ελωι" is a powerful and poignant word that carries deep emotional and spiritual meaning. It is associated with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and is often used in religious and artistic contexts to convey a sense of suffering, abandonment, and the human experience of questioning one's faith in times of hardship.
