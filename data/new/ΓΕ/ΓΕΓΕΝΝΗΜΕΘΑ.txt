Etymology: The word "γεγεννημένηθα" comes from the Greek verb "γεννώ" (gennó), which means "to give birth" or "to be born." The prefix "γε-" indicates completion or perfective aspect, and the suffix "-θα" indicates past tense. Therefore, "γεγεννημένηθα" can be translated as "I have been born" or "I was born."

Grammar: "γεγεννημένηθα" is the first person singular form of the verb "γεννώ" in the past perfect tense. In Greek grammar, the past perfect tense is used to express an action that was completed before another past action or time reference. It is formed by combining the auxiliary verb "έχω" (have) in the past tense with the past participle of the main verb.

Description: "γεγεννημένηθα" is a word used in Greek to indicate that someone has been born or was born. It is commonly used in narratives or descriptions to refer to the birth of a person or an event.
