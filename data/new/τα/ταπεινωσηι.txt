I'm sorry, but the word "ταπεινωσηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "ταπείνωση" (tapeínosi), which means "humiliation" or "humbleness". 

Etymology: The word "ταπείνωση" comes from the verb "ταπεινόω" (tapeinóo), which means "to humble" or "to lower". This verb is derived from the adjective "ταπεινός" (tapeinós), which means "humble" or "lowly".

Grammar: "ταπείνωση" is a feminine noun in the singular form.

Description: "ταπείνωση" refers to the act of humbling oneself or being humbled by others. It can also refer to a state of humility or lowliness. The word is often used in a religious or spiritual context, as humility is considered a virtue in many faiths.
