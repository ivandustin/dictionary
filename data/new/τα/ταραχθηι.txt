ταραχθηι (tarachthēi) is a Greek verb that is in the aorist tense and passive voice. It is derived from the root word ταράσσω (tarassō), which means "to disturb" or "to agitate." The suffix -θηι (-thēi) indicates that the action of the verb is being done to the subject, making it passive.

Therefore, ταραχθηι means "was disturbed" or "was agitated." It is often used in a figurative sense to describe emotional or mental turmoil.
