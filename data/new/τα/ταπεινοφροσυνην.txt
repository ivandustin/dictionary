ταπεινοφροσύνην (tapeinophrosynen) is a Greek word that combines two words: ταπείνωση (tapeinose) meaning "humility" and φρόνηση (phronese) meaning "prudence" or "wisdom". Therefore, ταπεινοφροσύνην means "humility" or "modesty" in English. 

In terms of grammar, ταπεινοφροσύνην is a noun in the accusative case, which is the case used for the direct object of a verb. 

This word is often used in religious or philosophical contexts to describe the virtue of being humble and having a modest opinion of oneself. It is considered a desirable trait in many cultures and is often associated with wisdom and inner strength.
