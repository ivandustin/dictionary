Word: ταπεινουσθαι

Etymology:
The word ταπεινουσθαι (tapeinousthai) is derived from the Greek root word ταπεινός (tapeinos), which means "lowly" or "humble". The suffix -ουσθαι (-ousthai) is a reflexive ending, indicating that the action is being done to oneself. Therefore, ταπεινουσθαι means "to humble oneself" or "to be humbled".

Grammar:
ταπεινουσθαι is a verb in the present tense, middle voice, and infinitive mood. In Greek, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, ταπεινουσθαι implies that the subject is actively humbling themselves.

Description:
ταπεινουσθαι is a term that is often used in a religious or spiritual context, referring to the act of humbling oneself before a higher power or deity. It can also be used more generally to describe the act of acknowledging one's own limitations or shortcomings and adopting a humble attitude towards others. In Greek philosophy, humility was considered a virtue and was often associated with wisdom and self-awareness.
