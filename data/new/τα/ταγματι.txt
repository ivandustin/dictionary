ταγματι (tagmati) is a Greek word that can be translated to mean "in formation" or "in order". It is derived from the Greek word τάγμα (tagma), which means "a unit" or "a group". In grammar, ταγματι is a noun in the dative case, which is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb or the object of certain prepositions. 

In ancient Greece, ταγματι was used to refer to a military formation or unit, such as a phalanx or a cavalry unit. It was also used to describe a group of people who were organized or arranged in a particular way, such as a group of dancers or musicians. 

Today, ταγματι is still used in modern Greek to refer to a group or organization that is structured in a particular way, such as a political party or a business. It can also be used more generally to describe something that is well-organized or orderly.
