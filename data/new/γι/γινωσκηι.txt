I'm sorry, but the word "γινωσκηι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the Greek word "γνωρίζω" (gnorizo), which means "to know" or "to recognize". 

Etymology: The word "γνωρίζω" comes from the Greek root word "γνώριμος" (gnorimos), which means "known" or "familiar". 

Grammar: "γνωρίζω" is a verb in the present tense, and it can be conjugated to match the subject of the sentence. For example, "Εγώ γνωρίζω" (Ego gnorizo) means "I know", while "Αυτός γνωρίζει" (Aftos gnorizei) means "He knows".

Description: "γνωρίζω" is a common and important verb in the Greek language, used to express knowledge or recognition of a person, place, or thing. It is often used in everyday conversation and in written texts.
