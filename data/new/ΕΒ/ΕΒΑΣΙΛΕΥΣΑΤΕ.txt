The word "εβασιλευσατε" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, second person plural form. It comes from the root word "βασιλεύω" (vasilevo), which means "to reign" or "to rule." The prefix "ε-" indicates the aorist tense, and the suffix "-σατε" indicates the second person plural form. Therefore, "εβασιλευσατε" translates to "you all reigned" or "you all ruled."
