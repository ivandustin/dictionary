The word "ηρμοσαμην" (hermosamen) is a verb in ancient Greek that is in the aorist tense and middle voice. It is derived from the root word "ἁρμόζω" (harmozo), which means "to fit together" or "to join." 

In terms of grammar, the aorist tense in Greek is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on themselves. 

Therefore, "ηρμοσαμην" can be translated as "I fitted myself together" or "I joined myself." It is often used in a metaphorical sense to describe someone who has reconciled or harmonized conflicting parts of themselves or their life.
