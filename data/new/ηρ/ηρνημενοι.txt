Word: ηρνημενοι

Etymology:
The word ηρνημενοι is a Greek verb in the perfect passive participle form. It comes from the root word ἀρνέομαι (arnéomai), which means "to deny" or "to refuse." The perfect passive participle form indicates that the action of denying or refusing has been completed in the past and the subject has been affected by it.

Grammar:
ηρνημενοι is a perfect passive participle in the masculine plural form. In Greek, participles are verbal adjectives that can function as nouns, adjectives, or verbs. The perfect tense indicates that the action has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:
ηρνημενοι can be translated as "having been denied" or "having refused." It is often used in the New Testament to describe those who have denied or rejected Jesus Christ. For example, in Matthew 10:33, Jesus says, "But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven." The use of the perfect tense emphasizes the ongoing consequences of denying or refusing, suggesting that those who have denied Christ continue to be affected by that decision.
