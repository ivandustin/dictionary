Word: συνειδησιν

Etymology: The word συνειδησιν comes from the Greek roots σύν (syn), meaning "together," and εἶδος (eidos), meaning "appearance" or "form." Together, they form the word συνείδηση (syneidēsē), which means "conscience" or "consciousness."

Grammar: συνειδησιν is a noun in the accusative case, which is used to indicate the direct object of a verb. In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The accusative case is used to indicate the noun that is directly affected by the action of the verb.

Description: συνειδησιν refers to the state of being conscious or aware of one's actions, thoughts, and feelings. It is often translated as "conscience" or "consciousness" in English. In Greek philosophy, συνείδηση was considered a fundamental aspect of human nature, and was seen as the source of moral judgment and ethical behavior. Today, the word is still used in modern Greek to refer to a person's sense of right and wrong, and their awareness of their own thoughts and actions.
