Word: συνερχομενων

Etymology:
συνερχομενων is a present participle of the Greek verb συνέρχομαι (synérchomai), which means "to come together" or "to assemble". The word is derived from the prefix συν- (syn-), meaning "together", and the verb ἔρχομαι (érchomai), meaning "to come".

Grammar:
συνερχομενων is a present participle in the genitive case, masculine gender, and plural number. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the present stem of the verb. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and in this case, it indicates that the participle is related to a noun in the genitive case.

Description:
συνερχομενων can be translated as "of those who are coming together" or "of those who are assembling". It is often used in the New Testament to describe groups of people who gather together for religious purposes, such as in Acts 20:7: "On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight." The word emphasizes the communal aspect of the gathering, highlighting the idea of people coming together as a group.
