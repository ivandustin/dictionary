The word συνπαρακληθηναι is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix συν- (meaning "together" or "with") and the verb παρακληθηναι (meaning "to be comforted" or "to be consoled"). The word can be translated to mean "to be comforted together" or "to be consoled together".

Grammar:

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. The infinitive form indicates that the verb is being used as a noun, and in this case, it is being used to describe an action that has not yet taken place.

Description:

The word is used to describe the idea of being comforted together with others who are experiencing similar afflictions. It suggests a sense of community and shared experience, where individuals can find comfort and support in one another.
