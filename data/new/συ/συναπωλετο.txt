Word: συναπωλετο

Etymology:
The word συναπωλετο is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix συν- (meaning "together" or "with") and the verb απωλετο (meaning "was lost" or "perished"). The word can be translated to mean "was lost together" or "perished together".

Grammar:
συναπωλετο is a third-person singular, past tense, middle voice form of the verb απόλλυμι (apollymi), which means "to destroy" or "to perish". The middle voice indicates that the subject is acting upon itself or is affected by the action in some way.

Description:
The word συναπωλετο is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Luke 15:9, where it is part of the parable of the lost coin. The parable tells the story of a woman who loses one of her ten silver coins and searches diligently until she finds it. When she does, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost!" (Luke 15:9, NASB). The word συναπωλετο is used to describe the state of the lost coin before it was found - it had perished or was lost together with the other coins.
