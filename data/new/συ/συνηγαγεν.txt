Etymology:
συν- (syn-) meaning "together"
ἀγαγεῖν (agagein) meaning "to lead, bring"

Therefore, συνηγαγεν (synēgagen) means "he/she/it brought together" or "he/she/it gathered".

Grammar:
συνηγαγεν is the aorist tense of the Greek verb συνάγω (synagō), which means "to gather, collect, assemble". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past.
