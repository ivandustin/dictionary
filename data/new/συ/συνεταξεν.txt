Word: συνεταξεν

Etymology: συν- (syn-) meaning "together" or "with" and τάσσω (tassō) meaning "to arrange" or "to put in order". Therefore, συνεταξεν (synetaxen) means "he/she/it arranged together" or "he/she/it put in order with".

Grammar: συνεταξεν is a verb in the aorist tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the root word τάσσω (tassō) and the prefix συν- (syn-).

Description: συνεταξεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible in Luke 7:8, where a centurion tells Jesus that he is not worthy to have him come under his roof, but that he believes Jesus can heal his servant if he just says the word. The centurion says, "For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it." The Greek word translated as "set under authority" is συνεταγμένος (synetagmenos), which is derived from the same root word as συνεταξεν. Therefore, συνεταξεν can be understood as "he/she/it arranged together" or "he/she/it put in order with" in the sense of commanding or directing others.
