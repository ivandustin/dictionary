The word συνκακουχεισθαι is a compound verb in ancient Greek, composed of the prefix συν- (meaning "together" or "with") and the verb κακουχεῖσθαι (meaning "to be ill-treated" or "to suffer hardship"). 

In terms of grammar, συνκακουχεισθαι is a passive verb in the present tense, indicating that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action. 

This word is often used in the context of describing someone who is enduring suffering or hardship alongside others, or who is being mistreated or oppressed in a group setting. It can also be used more broadly to describe any situation where people are experiencing difficulty or adversity together.
