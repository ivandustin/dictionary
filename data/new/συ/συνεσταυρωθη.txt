Word: συνεσταυρωθη

Etymology:
The word συνεσταυρωθη is a Greek word that is derived from the combination of two words: σύν (syn) meaning "together" and σταυρός (stauros) meaning "cross". The word is a compound verb that means "to be crucified together with".

Grammar:
συνεσταυρωθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by combining the prefix συν- (syn-) meaning "together" with the verb εσταυρωθη (estaurōthē) meaning "was crucified". The aorist tense indicates that the action of being crucified together with someone else happened in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject (in this case, Jesus Christ) was the recipient of the action.

Description:
συνεσταυρωθη is a word that is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It is used in several passages, including Galatians 2:20, where the apostle Paul writes, "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me." The word emphasizes the idea that Jesus Christ was not crucified alone, but that he was crucified together with others, including the two thieves who were crucified alongside him. The word also highlights the idea of unity and solidarity, as all those who believe in Jesus Christ are said to be "crucified with him" and to share in his suffering and death.
