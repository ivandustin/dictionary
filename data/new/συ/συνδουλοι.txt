Word: συνδούλοι

Etymology: The word συνδούλοι (syndouloi) is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix συν- (syn-), meaning "together" or "with," and the noun δοῦλος (doulos), meaning "slave." Therefore, the word συνδούλοι means "fellow slaves" or "co-slaves."

Grammar: συνδούλοι is a plural noun in Greek, meaning that it refers to more than one person. It is also a masculine noun, indicating that it refers to male slaves. In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence (e.g. subject, object, possessive), so the form of συνδούλοι will change depending on how it is used in a sentence.

Description: συνδούλοι was a common term in ancient Greece, where slavery was a widespread practice. It referred to a group of slaves who worked together under the same master. The term could also be used more broadly to refer to a group of people who were in a similar situation or had a common bond. Today, the word συνδούλοι is not commonly used in modern Greek, but it is still used in academic and historical contexts to describe the social and economic structures of ancient Greece.
