I'm sorry, but the word "συνκοινωνησητε" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "συνκοινωνήσετε" (synkoinonísete), which is the second person plural future tense of the verb "συνκοινωνέω" (synkoinonéo), meaning "to share in common, to participate jointly". 

Etymology: The word "συνκοινωνέω" is a compound word formed from the prefix "συν-" (syn-), meaning "together", and the verb "κοινωνέω" (koinonéo), meaning "to share, to participate". 

Grammar: "συνκοινωνήσετε" is a second person plural future tense verb, which means "you (all) will share/participate jointly". 

Description: The word "συνκοινωνήσετε" is a formal and somewhat rare word in modern Greek, often used in legal or business contexts. It implies a joint effort or collaboration between two or more parties.
