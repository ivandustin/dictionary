Word: συνεπιμαρτυρουντος

Etymology:
The word συνεπιμαρτυρουντος is a compound word in Greek, consisting of three parts: συν (syn), επι (epi), and μαρτυρουντος (marturountos). The prefix συν means "together" or "with," while επι means "upon" or "over." The root word μαρτυρουντος comes from the verb μαρτυρέω (martureo), which means "to bear witness" or "to testify." Therefore, the word συνεπιμαρτυρουντος can be translated as "bearing witness together" or "testifying together."

Grammar:
συνεπιμαρτυρουντος is a present participle in Greek, which means that it describes an ongoing action. It is in the masculine gender, singular number, and genitive case. The genitive case indicates possession or association, so the word συνεπιμαρτυρουντος can be translated as "of the one who testifies together" or "belonging to the one who bears witness together."

Description:
The word συνεπιμαρτυρουντος is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Romans 8:16 and 8:26. In both instances, it is used to describe the Holy Spirit as bearing witness or testifying together with believers. The word emphasizes the unity and partnership between the Holy Spirit and believers in their witness to the truth of God.
