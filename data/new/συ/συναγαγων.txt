Word: συναγαγων

Etymology: συν- (syn-) meaning "together" and ἄγω (agō) meaning "to lead". Therefore, συναγαγων (synagagōn) means "to lead together" or "to gather".

Grammar: συναγαγων is the aorist participle of the verb συνάγω (synagō), which means "to gather" or "to assemble". The aorist tense indicates that the action of gathering has been completed in the past.

Description: συναγαγων is used in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the Gospels, to describe the act of Jesus gathering his disciples or followers. For example, in Matthew 4:18-20, it is written: "And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him." Here, συναγαγων is used to describe Jesus gathering his disciples to follow him.
