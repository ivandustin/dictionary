Word: συνκεκαλυμμένον (synkekalymmenon)

Etymology: The word συνκεκαλυμμένον is a compound word in Greek, formed by the prefix συν- (syn-), meaning "together" or "with," and the verb καλύπτω (kalýpto), meaning "to cover" or "to conceal." Therefore, the literal meaning of συνκεκαλυμμένον is "covered together" or "concealed with."

Grammar: συνκεκαλυμμένον is a participle in the perfect passive voice, masculine gender, singular number, and accusative case. It is derived from the verb καλύπτω (kalýpto), which means "to cover" or "to conceal." The prefix συν- (syn-) indicates that the action is done together or with someone or something else.

Description: συνκεκαλυμμένον is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe something that is hidden or concealed. It is often used metaphorically to refer to spiritual truths that are not immediately apparent or visible. In Colossians 1:26, for example, the apostle Paul writes that the mystery of God's plan for salvation has been "hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints." The word συνκεκαλυμμένον emphasizes the idea that this mystery was not only hidden, but also covered or concealed with something else.
