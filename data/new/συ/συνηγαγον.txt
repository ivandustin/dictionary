Word: συνηγάγον

Etymology:
συν- (syn-) = together
ἀγάγω (agagō) = I lead, bring

συνηγάγον (synēgagon) is the aorist tense of the Greek verb συνάγω (synagō), which means "to gather together" or "to assemble." The prefix συν- (syn-) means "together," and ἀγάγω (agagō) means "I lead" or "I bring."

Grammar:
συνηγάγον is a third-person plural aorist active indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the third-person plural) performed the action.

Description:
συνηγάγον is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (13:32) and the Gospel of Mark (4:32), to describe the birds that come and nest in the branches of the mustard seed plant. The verb emphasizes the idea of gathering together, as the birds gather together in the branches of the plant.
