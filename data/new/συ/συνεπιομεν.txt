Word: συνεπιομεν

Etymology:
The word συνεπιομεν (synepiomen) is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix συν- (syn-), meaning "together," and the verb επιομαι (epioma), meaning "to drink." Therefore, the literal meaning of συνεπιομεν is "to drink together."

Grammar:
συνεπιομεν is a present participle in the active voice, masculine gender, and plural number. It is derived from the verb επιομαι (epioma), which means "to drink." The present participle form indicates that the action of drinking is ongoing and simultaneous with another action.

Description:
The word συνεπιομεν is not commonly used in modern Greek. It appears only once in the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 11:21, where it describes the practice of the early Christian community of sharing a common cup during the Lord's Supper. The word emphasizes the communal aspect of the ritual, as all participants drink from the same cup.
