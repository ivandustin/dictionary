Word: συνιδων

Etymology:
The word συνιδων is derived from the Greek roots συν- (syn-), meaning "together," and ἴδων (idōn), meaning "seeing" or "knowing." Therefore, the word συνιδων can be translated as "knowing together" or "seeing together."

Grammar:
συνιδων is a present participle in the masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. It is derived from the verb συνοιδα (synoida), which means "to know together" or "to be aware of together." The present participle form indicates that the action of knowing or being aware is ongoing or continuous.

Description:
The word συνιδων is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Romans (Romans 2:15). In this context, it is used to describe the Gentiles who do not have the written law of God but still have a sense of right and wrong because they have the law written on their hearts. The word implies a shared knowledge or awareness among a group of people.
