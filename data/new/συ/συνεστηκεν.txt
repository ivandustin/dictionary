Word: συνεστηκεν

Etymology:
συνεστηκεν is a Greek word that comes from the verb συνίστημι (synistēmi), which means "to set together, to place together, to bring together." The word is formed from the prefix συν- (syn-), which means "together," and the verb ἵστημι (histēmi), which means "to stand, to place, to set up."

Grammar:
συνεστηκεν is a third-person singular perfect indicative active form of the verb συνίστημι (synistēmi). In Greek, the perfect tense is used to describe an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The indicative mood is used to make a statement or ask a question. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description:
συνεστηκεν can be translated as "has been set up together" or "has been established." The word is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the establishment of the church. For example, in Ephesians 2:20, it says, "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit." Here, συνεστηκεν is used to describe the joining together of the building blocks of the church to form a holy temple in the Lord.
