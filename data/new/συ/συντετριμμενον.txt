Word: συντετριμμένον

Etymology:
The word συντετριμμένον is a Greek word that comes from the verb συντρίβω (syntribō), which means "to break into pieces" or "to crush." The word is formed by adding the prefix συν- (syn-), which means "together," to the verb τρίβω (tribō), which means "to rub" or "to wear away."

Grammar:
συντετριμμένον is the neuter singular form of the past participle of the verb συντρίβω (syntribō). It is used as an adjective to describe a noun that has been broken into pieces or crushed. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is feminine, masculine, or plural, the form of the adjective will change accordingly.

Description:
συντετριμμένον is a word that describes something that has been completely destroyed or shattered into pieces. It can be used to describe physical objects, such as a vase that has been dropped and shattered, or figurative concepts, such as a person's spirit that has been broken by a traumatic experience. The word conveys a sense of finality and irreversibility, as the object or concept that has been broken cannot be restored to its original state.
