Word: συνεκδημος

Etymology:
The word συνεκδημος is derived from two Greek words: συν (syn) meaning "together" and εκδημος (ekdemos) meaning "resident in a foreign country". Therefore, the literal meaning of συνεκδημος is "co-resident in a foreign country".

Grammar:
In Greek, συνεκδημος is an adjective that agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun, it will be συνεκδημος; if it modifies a feminine singular noun, it will be συνεκδημη; if it modifies a neuter singular noun, it will be συνεκδημον. In the plural, it will be συνεκδημοι for masculine, συνεκδημαι for feminine, and συνεκδημα for neuter.

Description:
The word συνεκδημος is used to describe someone who is a fellow resident in a foreign country. It can refer to someone who is from the same country as the speaker but is living abroad, or to someone who is from a different country but is living in the same foreign country as the speaker. The word can also be used more broadly to describe a group of people who are all living in a foreign country together.
