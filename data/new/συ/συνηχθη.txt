Word: συνηχθη

Etymology:
The word συνηχθη is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix συν- (meaning "together") and the verb ἀγω (meaning "to lead"). The prefix συν- indicates that the action of the verb is done together with someone or something else. The verb ἀγω means "to lead" or "to bring", so συνηχθη can be translated as "to be led together" or "to be brought together".

Grammar:
συνηχθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates that the action of the verb happened in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, συνηχθη) received the action of the verb rather than performing it. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
συνηχθη is a verb that means "to be gathered together" or "to be assembled". It is often used in the context of people or things coming together in a group or gathering. For example, it could be used to describe a group of people who have gathered together for a meeting or a festival. The verb can also be used in a more abstract sense, to describe ideas or concepts that are brought together or combined in some way.
