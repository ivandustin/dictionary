Word: εξεβληθη

Etymology: The word εξεβληθη comes from the Greek verb εκβάλλω (ekballō), which means "to throw out" or "to cast out". The prefix εξ- (ex-) means "out of" or "from", so εξεβληθη can be translated as "was thrown out" or "was cast out".

Grammar: εξεβληθη is a passive verb in the aorist tense, third person singular. The aorist tense in Greek is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the person or thing that was thrown out) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: εξεβληθη is a word that describes a forceful and sudden expulsion or ejection. It can be used in a literal sense, such as when referring to someone being thrown out of a building or a vehicle, or in a figurative sense, such as when describing someone being rejected or expelled from a group or organization. The word conveys a sense of abruptness and finality, suggesting that the action was not voluntary and that the person or thing being thrown out had no say in the matter.
