Word: εξειλαμην

Etymology:
The word εξειλαμην is a Greek verb that comes from the root word εἴλω (eilo), which means "to take, capture, or seize." The prefix εξ (ex) means "out of" or "from," so εξειλαμην can be translated as "I was rescued" or "I was delivered from."

Grammar:
εξειλαμην is a first-person singular aorist indicative passive verb in ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb. Therefore, εξειλαμην can be translated as "I was rescued" or "I was delivered from."
