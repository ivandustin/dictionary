Word: εξεδεχετο

Etymology: The word εξεδεχετο comes from the Greek verb εξεδέχομαι (exedéchomai), which means "to expect" or "to await". It is derived from the prefix εξ- (ex-), meaning "out of" or "from", and the verb δέχομαι (déchomai), meaning "to receive" or "to accept".

Grammar: εξεδεχετο is a third-person singular, imperfect, middle-passive indicative form of the verb εξεδέχομαι. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, aspect, voice, and mood. The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: εξεδεχετο can be translated as "he/she/it was expecting" or "he/she/it was awaiting". It describes a past action of waiting or expecting something to happen. The middle-passive voice suggests that the subject was both waiting and being waited for, or expecting and being expected by someone or something else.
