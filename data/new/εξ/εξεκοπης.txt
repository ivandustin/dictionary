Word: εξεκοπης

Etymology: The word εξεκοπης comes from the Greek verb "εκόπτω" (ekopto), which means "to cut off" or "to sever". The prefix "εξ-" (ex-) means "out of" or "from", so εξεκοπης can be translated as "cut off from".

Grammar: εξεκοπης is a noun in the genitive case, which means it is used to show possession or relationship to another noun. It is derived from the verb εκόπτω and the suffix "-ης" (-is), which is used to form nouns indicating a person or thing that performs a certain action or has a certain quality.

Description: εξεκοπης can be translated as "severed" or "cut off". It is often used in medical contexts to describe a body part that has been amputated or removed, or in a figurative sense to describe a relationship or connection that has been broken or ended.
