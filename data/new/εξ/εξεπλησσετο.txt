Word: εξεπλησσετο

Etymology: The word εξεπλησσετο comes from the Greek verb εκπλήσσω (ekplisso), which means "to strike with panic, to amaze, to astonish". The prefix εξ (ex) means "out of" or "from", so εξεπλησσετο can be translated as "he was struck with panic/amazement".

Grammar: εξεπλησσετο is a third person singular, past tense, indicative, middle voice form of the verb εκπλήσσω. The middle voice indicates that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action, so εξεπλησσετο can be translated as "he was amazed/stunned".

Description: εξεπλησσετο is a strong verb that conveys a sense of intense surprise or shock. It is often used in the New Testament to describe the reactions of people to Jesus' miracles and teachings. In modern Greek, it is still used to describe a state of shock or amazement.
