Word: εξεδετο

Etymology: The word εξεδετο comes from the Greek verb εξεδίδοτο (exedidoto), which is the third person singular, imperfect tense, middle voice of the verb εξεδίδω (exedido). This verb is derived from the prefix εξ- (ex-), meaning "out of," and the verb δίδω (dido), meaning "to give." Therefore, εξεδετο can be translated as "he/she/it was giving out."

Grammar: εξεδετο is a third person singular, imperfect tense, middle voice verb in Greek. The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, εξεδετο can be translated as "he/she/it was giving out (something) for himself/herself/itself."

Description: εξεδετο is a rare and archaic Greek verb that is not commonly used in modern Greek. It is mostly found in ancient Greek texts and literature. The verb implies an action of giving out or distributing something, but with a focus on the subject's own benefit or interest. The middle voice also suggests a sense of self-reliance or self-sufficiency.
