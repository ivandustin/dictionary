Word: εξελεγοντο

Etymology: The word εξελεγοντο comes from the Greek verb ἐκλέγομαι (eklégomai), which means "to choose" or "to select". The prefix εξ- (ex-) means "out of" or "from", so εξελεγοντο can be translated as "they were chosen out of" or "they were selected from".

Grammar: εξελεγοντο is the third person plural, past tense, middle voice form of the verb ἐκλέγομαι (eklégomai). In Greek, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action. So, εξελεγοντο can be translated as "they chose themselves" or "they selected themselves".
