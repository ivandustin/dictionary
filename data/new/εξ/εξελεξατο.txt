Word: εξελεξατο

Etymology: The word εξελεξατο comes from the Greek verb ἐκλέγομαι (eklégomai), which means "to choose" or "to select". The prefix εξ- (ex-) means "out of" or "from", so εξελεξατο can be translated as "he/she/it chose out of" or "he/she/it selected from".

Grammar: εξελεξατο is the third person singular aorist middle/passive indicative form of the verb ἐκλέγομαι (eklégomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action. Therefore, εξελεξατο can be translated as "he/she/it chose for himself/herself/itself" or "he/she/it was chosen for himself/herself/itself".

Description: εξελεξατο is a word that describes an action of choosing or selecting. It can be used in various contexts, such as in politics, where a candidate is chosen by the people or a party, or in everyday life, where someone chooses a particular item from a selection of options. The word emphasizes the idea of making a deliberate and intentional choice, rather than simply accepting what is given.
