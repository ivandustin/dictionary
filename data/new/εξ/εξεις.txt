Word: εξεις

Etymology: The word εξεις comes from the Greek verb είπα (eipa), which means "to say" or "to speak". The prefix εξ- (ex-) adds the meaning of "out" or "forth", so εξεις can be translated as "you said" or "you spoke out".

Grammar: εξεις is the second person singular of the aorist tense of the verb είπα. It is used to address one person directly and indicate that they said or spoke something in the past.

Description: εξεις is a common word in modern Greek, used in everyday conversation to refer to something that someone said or spoke in the past. It is often used in combination with other words to form longer phrases, such as εξεις και εγώ (exis kai ego), which means "you said it and I agree".
