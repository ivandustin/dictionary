Word: εξεστημένος (exestimenos)

Etymology: The word εξεστημένος comes from the Greek verb εξίσταμαι (existamai), which means "to be amazed" or "to be astonished". The prefix εξ- (ex-) means "out of" or "from", and the suffix -μένος (-menos) is a participle ending that indicates a state or condition. Therefore, εξεστημένος can be translated as "being out of one's mind" or "being astonished".

Grammar: εξεστημένος is a masculine singular adjective in the nominative case. It agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if we want to say "the astonished man", we would use the phrase ο εξεστημένος άντρας (o exestimenos antras).

Description: εξεστημένος is an adjective that describes a state of extreme surprise, shock, or confusion. It can be used to describe a person who is so amazed or astonished that they are temporarily out of their mind or unable to think clearly. It can also be used to describe a situation or event that is so unexpected or shocking that it leaves people speechless.
