I'm sorry, but the word "εξαναστησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "εξαναστάτωση" (exanastátosi), which means "uprising" or "rebellion". 

Etymology: The word is derived from the verb "αναστατώνω" (anastatóno), which means "to disturb" or "to unsettle", and the prefix "εξ-" (ex-), which indicates "out of" or "from". 

Grammar: The word is a noun, feminine gender, and in the singular form. 

Description: "Εξαναστάτωση" refers to a political or social movement that aims to overthrow the existing government or authority. It is often associated with revolutionary or insurgent activities.
