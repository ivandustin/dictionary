Word: εξεκρεμετο

Etymology: The word εξεκρεμετο comes from the Greek verb κρεμάννυμι (kremannymi), which means "to hang up" or "to suspend". The prefix εξ- (ex-) means "out of" or "from", so εξεκρεμετο can be translated as "was hung out" or "was suspended".

Grammar: εξεκρεμετο is a third-person singular past tense passive verb in the Greek language. It is in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (in this case, εξεκρεμετο) received the action of the verb rather than performing it.

Description: εξεκρεμετο can be translated as "was hung out" or "was suspended". It is often used in a figurative sense to describe someone who has been left out to dry or abandoned by others. It can also be used to describe something that has been left hanging or unresolved.
