Word: εξελεξαντο

Etymology: The word εξελεξαντο comes from the Greek verb εκλέγομαι (eklégomai), which means "to choose" or "to select". The prefix εξ- (ex-) adds the meaning of "out of" or "from among", so εξελεξαντο means "they chose from among themselves".

Grammar: εξελεξαντο is the third person plural, aorist middle-passive indicative form of the verb εκλέγομαι. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, the subject is plural and refers to a group of people who chose from among themselves.

Description: εξελεξαντο is a word that describes a specific action taken by a group of people. It implies that the group had a choice to make and that they made it collectively, selecting someone or something from among themselves. The word can be used in a variety of contexts, such as politics, sports, or social groups, to describe the process of choosing a leader, a team captain, or a representative.
