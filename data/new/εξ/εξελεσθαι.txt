Word: εξελεσθαι

Etymology: 
The word εξελεσθαι comes from the Greek verb ἐξέλεγχος (exélechos), which means "to convict" or "to refute". It is derived from the prefix ἐξ- (ex-), meaning "out of" or "from", and the verb ἐλέγχω (eléncho), meaning "to prove" or "to demonstrate".

Grammar:
εξελεσθαι is a verb in the aorist tense, middle voice, and infinitive mood. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on itself. The infinitive mood is used to express the idea of an action without specifying who is performing it.

Description:
εξελεσθαι can be translated as "to convict oneself" or "to refute oneself". It is often used in a legal context to describe a situation where a person's own words or actions are used against them in court. It can also be used more broadly to describe a situation where someone's own behavior or statements contradict their previous position or argument.
