Word: εξαπεσταλη

Etymology: εξαπεσταλη is a Greek word that comes from the verb αποστέλλω (apostello), which means "to send away" or "to dispatch". The prefix εξα- (exa-) means "out of" or "from", so εξαπεσταλη can be translated as "sent out" or "dispatched".

Grammar: εξαπεσταλη is a passive verb in the aorist tense, third person singular. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: εξαπεσταλη is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the sending out of Jesus' disciples to preach the gospel. It is also used to describe the sending of angels or messengers from God. In modern Greek, εξαπεσταλη can be used to describe the sending of a message or a package.
