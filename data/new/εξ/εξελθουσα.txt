Word: εξελθουσα

Etymology: 
The word εξελθουσα is a feminine form of the Greek verb εξέρχομαι (exérchomai), which means "to go out" or "to come out". It is derived from the prefix εξ- (ex-), meaning "out of", and the verb έρχομαι (érchomai), meaning "to come".

Grammar:
εξελθουσα is the feminine singular form of the aorist participle of the verb εξέρχομαι (exérchomai). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The participle form is used to describe an action that is happening at the same time as the main verb or as a modifier of a noun.

Description:
εξελθουσα can be translated as "having gone out" or "coming out". It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the actions of Jesus or other characters. For example, in Mark 5:33, a woman who had been healed by Jesus "came out (εξελθουσα) in fear and trembling". In Luke 8:47, the same woman "came out (εξελθουσα) before all the people and told why she had touched him". The word can also be used in a more general sense to describe any action of going out or coming out of a place or situation.
