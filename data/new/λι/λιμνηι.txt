Sorry, I cannot perform this task as the word "λιμνηι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the Greek word "λίμνη" which means "lake". If that is the case, I can provide the following information:

Etymology: The word "λίμνη" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *leǵʰ-, meaning "to collect" or "to gather".

Grammar: "Λίμνη" is a feminine noun in Greek and belongs to the second declension. Its genitive form is "λίμνης" and its plural form is "λίμνες".

Description: "Λίμνη" refers to a large body of water surrounded by land. It can be natural or artificial and can vary in size from small ponds to large lakes. In Greek mythology, there were several lakes that were believed to be sacred and inhabited by gods and goddesses.
