Description: λιθασαντες is a word used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11). In this story, the scribes and Pharisees bring a woman to Jesus who they claim was caught in the act of adultery. They ask Jesus if they should stone her, as the law of Moses commands. Jesus responds by saying, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." The scribes and Pharisees then leave, one by one, until only Jesus and the woman are left. Jesus tells the woman that he does not condemn her, and to go and sin no more. The word λιθασαντες is used to describe the scribes and Pharisees who were ready to stone the woman.
