The word βασανου (basanou) is a Greek noun that means "torture" or "torment". It is derived from the verb βάσανος (basanos), which means "touchstone" or "test". In ancient Greece, a basanos was a black stone used to test the purity of gold or silver. Later, the word came to be used metaphorically to refer to any kind of test or trial, and eventually to the idea of torture or torment. In grammar, βασανου is a singular noun in the genitive case.
