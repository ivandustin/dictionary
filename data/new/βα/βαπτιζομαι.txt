Word: βαπτίζομαι

Etymology:
The word βαπτίζομαι (baptizomai) comes from the Greek verb βαπτίζω (baptizo), which means "to dip" or "to immerse." In ancient Greece, the word was used to describe the process of dyeing cloth by immersing it in a colored liquid. In the New Testament, the word took on a religious meaning, referring to the act of baptism, which involves immersing a person in water as a symbol of their spiritual cleansing and rebirth.

Grammar:
βαπτίζομαι (baptizomai) is a reflexive verb in Greek, which means that the subject of the verb is also the object of the action. In other words, when someone says "I baptize myself," they would use the reflexive form βαπτίζομαι (baptizomai) instead of the non-reflexive form βαπτίζω (baptizo).
