Word: βαπτισθητω

Etymology:
The word βαπτισθητω is a Greek word that comes from the verb βαπτίζω (baptizō), which means "to dip, to immerse, to wash". It is derived from the noun βάπτω (baptō), which means "to dip, to dye". In Christian theology, the word is associated with the act of baptism, which involves the immersion of a person in water as a symbol of purification and rebirth.

Grammar:
βαπτισθητω is a passive imperative verb form in the aorist tense, third person singular, in the Greek language. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action. The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests. The aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without specifying its duration or repetition.

Description:
βαπτισθητω is a command that means "let him/her be baptized" or "let it be baptized". It is often used in Christian liturgy as a call to baptism, or as a reminder of the importance of baptism in the Christian faith. The word emphasizes the passive nature of the act of baptism, which is seen as a gift of grace from God rather than a human achievement.
