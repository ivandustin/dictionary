Sorry, I cannot provide a definition for the word "βαθμον" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "βαθμόν" which means "step" or "degree" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "βαθμόν" comes from the Greek word "βαθμός" (bathmós) which means "step" or "degree". 

Grammar: βαθμόν is the accusative singular form of βαθμός. 

Description: βαθμόν refers to a step or degree in a process or progression. It can also refer to a level of achievement or rank.
