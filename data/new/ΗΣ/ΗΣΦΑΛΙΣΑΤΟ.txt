The word "ησφαλισατο" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, third person singular form. It comes from the root word "σφαλίζω" (sphalízo), which means "to secure" or "to make safe." The prefix "η-" (e-) indicates the aorist tense, and the suffix "-σατο" (-sato) indicates the third person singular form. In English, it can be translated as "he/she/it secured" or "he/she/it made safe."
