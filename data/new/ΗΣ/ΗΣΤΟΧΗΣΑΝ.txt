The word "ηστοχησαν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, third person plural form. It comes from the root word "στοχάζομαι" (stocházomai), which means "to consider" or "to think about." The prefix "ε-" (e-) indicates the past tense, and the suffix "-αν" (-an) indicates the third person plural form. Therefore, "ηστοχησαν" translates to "they considered" or "they thought about" in English.
