Etymology: The word "φυλακή" comes from the ancient Greek word "φυλάσσω" (pronounced "filasso"), which means "to guard" or "to protect". 

Grammar: "Φυλακή" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "φυλακές" (pronounced "filakes"). 

Description: "Φυλακή" refers to a place where people are confined as a punishment for a crime they have committed. It can also refer to a place where political prisoners or prisoners of war are held.
