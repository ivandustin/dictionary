The word "φυλαι" (phylai) is a plural noun in Greek, which means "tribes" or "clans". It is derived from the Greek word "φυλή" (phylē), which means "tribe" or "race". In ancient Greece, the phylai were groups of people who shared a common ancestry or geographical origin and were organized into political units. The phylai played an important role in the political and social life of ancient Greece, particularly in the city-state of Athens. The word "phylai" is still used in modern Greek to refer to tribes or clans, although its usage is less common than in ancient times. In terms of grammar, "φυλαι" is a third declension noun in Greek, which means that its endings change depending on its grammatical case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, etc.) and number (singular or plural).
