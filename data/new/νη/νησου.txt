The word "νησου" (nēsou) is a Greek noun that means "island" in English. It is derived from the Greek word "νῆσος" (nēsos), which also means "island". In terms of grammar, "νησου" is in the genitive case, which is used to indicate possession or relationship. 

For example, "τὸ νησί τῆς Κρήτης" (to nēsi tēs Krētēs) means "the island of Crete" in English, where "τῆς Κρήτης" (tēs Krētēs) is the genitive form of "Κρήτη" (Krētē), the name of the island. 

In terms of description, "νησου" can refer to any landmass that is completely surrounded by water, regardless of its size or location. Greece, for example, is known for its many islands, including Crete, Santorini, and Mykonos. Islands can be formed by volcanic activity, erosion, or tectonic movement, and can vary greatly in terms of climate, flora, and fauna.
