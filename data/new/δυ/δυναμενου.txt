Word: δυναμενου

Etymology: δυναμενου is the present participle of the Greek verb δύναμαι (dynamai), which means "to be able" or "to have power". The word comes from the root δυνα- (dyna-), which means "power" or "ability".

Grammar: δυναμενου is a masculine singular genitive form of the present participle of the verb δύναμαι (dynamai). In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -μενος (-menos) to the present stem of the verb. The genitive case is used to show possession or relationship to another noun.

Description: δυναμενου can be translated as "of the one who is able" or "of the one who has power". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the power or ability of God or Jesus. For example, in Mark 9:23, Jesus says to a man who asks him to heal his son, "If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes." The word δυναμενου is used here to emphasize the power and ability of faith.
