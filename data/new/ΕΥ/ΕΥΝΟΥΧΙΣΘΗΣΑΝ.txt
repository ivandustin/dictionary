Etymology: The word "ευνούχισθησαν" comes from the Greek verb "ευνουχίζω" (eunouchizo), which means "to castrate" or "to make a eunuch." It is derived from the noun "ευνούχος" (eunouchos), meaning "eunuch," and the suffix "-ίζω" (-izo), which is used to form verbs.

Grammar: "ευνούχισθησαν" is the third person plural, aorist passive voice form of the verb "ευνουχίζω" (eunouchizo). The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb receives the action. In this case, the subject is plural, referring to multiple individuals who were castrated or made eunuchs.
