Etymology: The word "ευρεθην" (eurethen) comes from the Greek verb "εὑρίσκω" (heurískō), which means "to find" or "to discover". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *wer- meaning "to perceive, find".

Grammar: "ευρεθην" is the aorist passive form of the verb "εὑρίσκω" (heurískō) in Greek. The aorist tense is used to express a completed action in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: "ευρεθην" is the first person singular form of the aorist passive tense in Greek. It can be translated as "I was found" or "I was discovered". This form is used when the subject is the receiver of the action rather than the doer.
