Etymology: The word "ευλογείται" comes from the Greek verb "ευλογώ" (evlogó), which means "to bless" or "to praise." It is derived from the combination of the prefix "ευ-" (eu-), meaning "good" or "well," and the verb "λογίζομαι" (logízomai), meaning "to reckon" or "to consider."

Grammar: "Ευλογείται" is the third person singular form of the present tense passive voice of the verb "ευλογώ" (evlogó). In Greek grammar, the verb conjugation changes based on the subject, tense, mood, and voice. In this case, "ευλογείται" indicates that the subject is in the third person singular and the action is being done to the subject.
