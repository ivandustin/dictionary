Etymology: The word "ευνούχος" (eunouchos) comes from the Greek roots "ευ" (eu), meaning "good" or "well," and "νοῦς" (nous), meaning "mind" or "intelligence." It originally referred to a person who was castrated in order to serve as a guardian of the harem or a high-ranking official in ancient Eastern courts.

Grammar: In Greek, "ευνούχος" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It belongs to the second declension and has the plural form "ευνούχοι" (eunouchoi).

Description: "Ευνούχος" is a term used to describe a castrated male, particularly in historical contexts. In ancient times, eunuchs were often employed as servants or officials in royal courts, where their lack of reproductive capabilities was seen as an advantage in terms of loyalty and trustworthiness. They played various roles, such as guarding the harem, managing the household, or serving as advisors to the ruler. The term can also be used metaphorically to refer to someone who lacks power or influence.
