Etymology: The word "ευφρανθώμεν" comes from the Greek verb "ευφραίνω" (euphraino), which means "to make happy" or "to cheer up." It is derived from the combination of the prefix "ευ-" (eu-), meaning "good" or "well," and the verb "φραίνω" (phraino), meaning "to make joyful" or "to gladden."

Grammar: "Ευφρανθώμεν" is the first person plural, aorist subjunctive passive form of the verb "ευφραίνω" (euphraino). The aorist tense indicates a past action, the subjunctive mood expresses possibility or potentiality, and the passive voice indicates that the subject receives the action. Therefore, "ευφρανθώμεν" can be translated as "let us be made happy" or "may we be cheered up."
