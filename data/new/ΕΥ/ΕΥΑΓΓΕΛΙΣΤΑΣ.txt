Grammar: In Greek, "ευαγγελιστας" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It is the singular form of the word, and it can be used to refer to a male evangelist or someone who spreads the good news of the gospel.

Description: An "ευαγγελιστας" is a person who proclaims or spreads the good news of the gospel. In Christian tradition, it often refers to the four authors of the canonical Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These evangelists are believed to have written the accounts of Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection. The term can also be used more broadly to describe anyone who shares or promotes the Christian message.
