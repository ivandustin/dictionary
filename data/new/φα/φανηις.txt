The word "φανηις" (phanēis) is a Greek noun that means "a torchbearer" or "a light-bearer". It is derived from the verb "φαίνω" (phainō), which means "to shine" or "to appear". In Greek mythology, the goddess Hecate was often depicted as a torchbearer, and the word "phanēis" was sometimes used to refer to her attendants or followers who carried torches. 

In terms of grammar, "phanēis" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive "phanēidos" (of a torchbearer) or the accusative "phanēin" (to a torchbearer). 

Overall, "phanēis" is a word that connotes illumination, guidance, and perhaps even mystery or magic, given its association with Hecate and her torch-bearing attendants.
