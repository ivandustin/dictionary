Description:
φασις is a term used in ancient Greek philosophy to refer to the appearance or manifestation of something. It is often contrasted with the underlying reality or essence of that thing. The concept of φασις is central to the philosophy of the Presocratic philosopher Heraclitus, who believed that the world is in a constant state of flux and that the only constant is change. For Heraclitus, the world of appearances (φασις) is constantly changing, while the underlying reality (λόγος, logos) remains the same.
