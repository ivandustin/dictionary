Word: φανερωθησεσθε

Etymology: 
The word φανερωθησεσθε is a Greek word that comes from the verb φανερόω (phaneroó), which means "to make visible, to reveal, to manifest." The suffix -θησεσθε (-thesesthe) is a passive voice ending that indicates that the action of the verb is being done to the subject of the sentence. Therefore, φανερωθησεσθε means "you will be revealed, you will be made visible."

Grammar:
φανερωθησεσθε is a second-person plural future passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the future tense ending -σεσθε (-sesthe) to the passive voice ending -θη (-the) of the verb φανερόω (phaneroó). The verb is conjugated as follows:

φανερωθήσεσθε (phanerōthēsesthe) - you will be revealed

Description:
φανερωθησεσθε is a biblical term that appears in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (10:26) and in the First Epistle of Peter (4:13). In both cases, it is used to encourage believers to have faith and not fear persecution or suffering, as their faith will ultimately be revealed and rewarded. The word emphasizes the idea that what is hidden will eventually be made known, and that the truth will come to light.
