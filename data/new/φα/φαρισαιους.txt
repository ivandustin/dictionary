The word "φαρισαιους" (pharisaious) is a Greek term that refers to a group of Jewish religious leaders who were known for their strict adherence to the Jewish law and traditions. The word is derived from the Hebrew word "perushim," which means "separated ones" or "those who are set apart." The Pharisees were a prominent group during the Second Temple period and were often in conflict with Jesus and his followers in the New Testament. In terms of grammar, "φαρισαιους" is the plural form of "φαρισαιος" (pharisaio), which means "Pharisee" in Greek.
