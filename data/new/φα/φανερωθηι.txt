Grammar: φανερωθηι is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb φανερόω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: φανερωθηι means "was revealed" or "was made manifest" in English. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context to describe a divine revelation or the manifestation of a deity. The word appears several times in the New Testament of the Bible, including in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, where it is used to describe the revelation of Jesus Christ to his disciples after his death and resurrection.
