The word "φαρισαιοι" (pharisaioi) is a Greek term that refers to a Jewish sect that emerged in the Second Temple period. The word is derived from the Hebrew word "perushim," which means "separated ones." The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to Jewish law and their belief in the resurrection of the dead. They were also known for their opposition to the Sadducees, another Jewish sect that rejected the idea of the resurrection. In terms of grammar, "φαρισαιοι" is a plural noun in the nominative case.
