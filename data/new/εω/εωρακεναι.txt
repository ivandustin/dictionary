The word "εωρακεναι" is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the Greek verb "εἶδον" (eidon), which means "I saw" in English. 

Etymology: The verb "εἶδον" comes from the ancient Greek root "εἰδ-" which means "to see" or "to perceive". 

Grammar: "εἶδον" is a first aorist active indicative verb, which means it is used to describe a completed action in the past. 

Description: The verb "εἶδον" is commonly used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe seeing or perceiving something, such as a vision or a physical object. It is also used in everyday Greek to describe seeing something with one's own eyes.
