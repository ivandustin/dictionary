The word "εωρακοτες" (eōrakotes) is a Greek verb in the perfect tense, which means "to have seen" or "having seen". It is derived from the verb "οραω" (orao), which means "to see". In terms of grammar, it is a participle, which is a type of verb that functions as an adjective. 

The word can be broken down into two parts: "εωρα" (eōra), which is the stem of the verb "οραω", and "κοτες" (kotes), which is the ending for the perfect participle in the masculine plural form. 

In English, the word can be translated as "those who have seen" or "having seen ones". It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe individuals who have witnessed a particular event or phenomenon.
