μνησθήτε (mnēsthēte) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, imperative mood, and second person plural form. It is derived from the root word μνάομαι (mnaomai), which means "to remember" or "to recall". In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a completed action in the past, while the imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests.

So, μνησθήτε can be translated as "remember" or "recall" in English. It is a command or request for a group of people to remember or recall something.
