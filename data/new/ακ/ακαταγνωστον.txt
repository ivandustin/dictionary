Word: ακαταγνωστον

Etymology: The word ακαταγνωστον comes from the Greek roots α- (a-), meaning "not," καταγινώσκω (kataginósko), meaning "to recognize," and the suffix -τον (-ton), which forms an adjective. Therefore, ακαταγνωστον means "unrecognizable" or "unknown."

Grammar: ακαταγνωστον is a neuter adjective in the singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, ακαταγνωστον can modify a neuter noun like όνομα (ónoma), meaning "name," to form the phrase ακαταγνωστον όνομα (akatagnóston ónoma), meaning "unknown name."
