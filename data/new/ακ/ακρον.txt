Word: ακρον

Etymology:
The word ακρον (akron) is derived from the Greek word ἄκρος (akros), which means "highest," "topmost," or "extreme." It is also related to the word ἀκρόασις (akroasis), which means "hearing" or "listening."

Grammar:
ακρον is a neuter noun in Greek, and its nominative singular form is ακρον. In the plural, it becomes ακρα (akra). It is often used in the genitive case, as in ακρον τοῦ δακτύλου (akron tou daktylou), which means "the tip of the finger."

Description:
ακρον refers to the highest or topmost point of something. It can be used to describe the peak of a mountain, the tip of a pencil, or the end of a road. In Greek mythology, the god Zeus was said to have lived on the highest peak of Mount Olympus, which was called ακρον Όλυμπου (akron Olympou). The word can also be used metaphorically to describe the most extreme or intense aspect of something, such as the ακρον τῆς χαρᾶς (akron tes charas), or "height of joy."
