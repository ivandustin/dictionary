Word: ηιτησατο

Etymology: The word ηιτησατο is a conjugated form of the ancient Greek verb αἰτέω (aiteo), which means "to ask for, demand, or request." The verb is derived from the noun αἴτημα (aitēma), which means "request" or "demand."

Grammar: ηιτησατο is the third person singular aorist middle indicative form of αἰτέω. In ancient Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is acting upon itself or for its own benefit.

Description: ηιτησατο can be translated as "he/she/it asked for/requested/demanded for himself/herself/itself." The word implies that the subject made a specific request or demand, and that the action was completed in the past. The middle voice suggests that the subject was acting on its own behalf, rather than asking someone else to do something.
