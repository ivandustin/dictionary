Word: σαμαρειται

Etymology: The word σαμαρειται comes from the Greek word Σαμαρείτης (Samareítēs), which means "a resident of Samaria". Samaria was a region in ancient Palestine, located between Galilee to the north and Judea to the south.

Grammar: σαμαρειται is a verb in the present tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the verb σαμαρεύω (samareúō), which means "to gather up, to collect". The -ται (-tai) ending indicates that the verb is in the middle or passive voice.

Description: σαμαρειται is used in the New Testament of the Bible in the story of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37). In this story, a man is beaten and left for dead on the side of the road. A priest and a Levite pass by without helping him, but a Samaritan stops to care for him. The word σαμαρειται is used to describe the Samaritan's actions of gathering up the wounded man and taking him to an inn to be cared for. The story is often used as an example of compassion and kindness towards others, regardless of their background or social status.
