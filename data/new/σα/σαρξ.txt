Word: σαρξ

Etymology:
The word σαρξ (sarx) is a Greek word that means "flesh" or "body." It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *sker- which means "to cut" or "to separate."

Grammar:
In Greek, σαρξ is a feminine noun. It is declined in the nominative case as follows: η σαρξ (i sarx) - the flesh. In the genitive case, it is declined as της σαρκός (tis sarkos) - of the flesh.

Description:
The word σαρξ is used in the New Testament of the Bible to refer to the physical body of a person. It is often used in contrast to the spirit or soul. In Christian theology, the concept of the "flesh" is often associated with sin and the fallen nature of humanity. However, in other contexts, the word can simply refer to the physical body without any moral connotations.
