Word: σαμαρειτων

Etymology:
The word σαμαρειτων (samareitōn) is a Greek word that is derived from the Hebrew word שומרון (Shomron), which means "Samaria." Samaria was a region in ancient Israel that was located between Judea and Galilee.

Grammar:
σαμαρειτων is a plural noun in the genitive case. In Greek, the genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship. Therefore, σαμαρειτων can be translated as "of the Samaritans."

Description:
σαμαρειτων refers to the Samaritans, a group of people who lived in the region of Samaria during the time of Jesus. The Samaritans were a mixed race of people who were descended from Israelites and foreigners who had been brought to the region by the Assyrians. They had their own version of the Torah and their own temple on Mount Gerizim. The Samaritans were often looked down upon by the Jews, who considered them to be impure and heretical. However, Jesus showed compassion towards the Samaritans and even used them as examples of good behavior in his parables.
