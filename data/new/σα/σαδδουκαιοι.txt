Description:
The Sadducees were a Jewish sect that existed during the Second Temple period, from the 2nd century BCE until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. They were known for their strict adherence to the written Torah and rejection of the oral tradition. They were also known for their denial of the resurrection of the dead and the existence of angels and spirits. The Sadducees were primarily composed of the wealthy and aristocratic class, and they held significant political power in Judea. They were often in conflict with the Pharisees, another Jewish sect that was more popular among the common people.
