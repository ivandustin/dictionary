Description:
The Sadducees were a Jewish sect that existed during the Second Temple period, from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. They were known for their strict adherence to the written Torah and their rejection of the oral tradition. They were also known for their belief in the resurrection of the dead and their denial of the existence of angels and spirits. The Sadducees were a small but influential group, and many of their members were priests and aristocrats. They were often in conflict with the Pharisees, another Jewish sect that was more popular among the common people. The Sadducees disappeared after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.
