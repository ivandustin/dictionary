Word: σακκους

Etymology:
The word σακκους (sakkous) is derived from the Hebrew word "sak" which means "sackcloth". It was used in ancient times to refer to a coarse, rough material made from goat or camel hair. The word was later adopted by the Greeks and used to refer to a bag or sack made from this material.

Grammar:
In Greek, σακκους is a masculine noun of the second declension. Its nominative singular form is σακκος (sakkos) and its genitive singular form is σακκου (sakkou). The word is also used in the plural form, σακκοι (sakkoi).

Description:
In ancient times, σακκους was used as a material for making bags, sacks, and clothing. It was also used as a symbol of mourning or repentance, as people would wear sackcloth as a sign of grief or remorse. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe the clothing worn by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:4) and by the people of Nineveh when they repented (Jonah 3:5-8). Today, the word σακκους is rarely used in modern Greek, except in religious or historical contexts.
