I'm sorry, but the word "σαπφειρηι" is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "σαπφείρου" (sapphire) with an extra "ι" added at the end. 

Etymology: The word "σαπφείρου" comes from the Greek word "σάπφειρος" (sappheiros), which means "blue stone". It is derived from the Hebrew word "sappir" which also means "sapphire".

Grammar: "Σαπφείρου" is a noun in the genitive case, which is used to show possession or relationship. It is the genitive form of the word "σάπφειρος".

Description: "Σαπφείρου" refers to the gemstone sapphire, which is a precious stone that is typically blue in color. It is often used in jewelry and is also the birthstone for the month of September.
