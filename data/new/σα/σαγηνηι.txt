Description: In ancient Greece, fishing was an important activity for both subsistence and commerce. The use of nets, such as the sagēnēi, was a common method for catching fish. The sagēnēi was a large, rectangular net that was dragged through the water by a group of fishermen. The net would trap fish as it was pulled along, and the catch would be collected at the end of the drag. The sagēnēi was also used in warfare, as it could be used to trap enemy ships.
