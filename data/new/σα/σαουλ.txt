Grammar:
In Greek, σαουλ is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It is spelled σαούλ in Modern Greek.

Description:
In the New Testament, σαουλ is primarily known as the Greek name of the apostle Paul. Paul was originally named Saul, but he changed his name after his conversion to Christianity. In Acts 13:9, it is said that Saul was also known as Paul, which suggests that he may have used both names throughout his life. The name Saul is also mentioned in the Old Testament as the first king of Israel, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel.
