Description: σαλπισωσιν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in 1 Corinthians 14:8, where it is translated as "sound the trumpet". The verse is part of a larger discussion about the use of spiritual gifts in the church, and the importance of using them in an orderly and understandable way. The verb σαλπίζω is also used in other parts of the New Testament to describe the sounding of trumpets in various contexts, such as announcing the arrival of a king or signaling the start of a battle.
