The word "αλοης" (aloes) is a Greek noun that refers to a type of plant that is known for its medicinal properties. The word comes from the Greek word "άλς" (als), which means "salt," and "οίνος" (oinos), which means "wine." This is because the plant was often used to flavor wine in ancient times. 

In terms of grammar, "αλοης" is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive "αλοητος" (aloetos) or the accusative "αλοην" (aloen). 

The plant itself is a succulent that is native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It has long, pointed leaves that are often used to make aloe vera gel, which is used in a variety of skincare and health products. The plant has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, and is believed to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties.
