The word "αλωνα" (alona) is a Greek noun that refers to a threshing floor, which is a flat surface where grain is separated from the chaff. 

Etymology: The word comes from the ancient Greek verb "αλωνίζω" (alonizo), which means "to thresh." 

Grammar: "αλωνα" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: In ancient times, the threshing floor was an important part of agriculture, as it was used to separate the edible grain from the inedible chaff. The process involved spreading the harvested grain on the floor and then using animals or machines to trample or beat it, separating the grain from the husks. The threshing floor was often located in an open area, where the wind could help blow away the chaff. Today, the word "αλωνα" is still used in Greece to refer to a threshing floor, although the traditional method of threshing has largely been replaced by modern machinery.
