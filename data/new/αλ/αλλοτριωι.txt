I'm sorry, but the word "αλλοτριωι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "αλλοτρίωτος" which means "alien" or "foreign". 

Etymology: The word "αλλοτρίωτος" comes from the Greek word "άλλος" (allos) meaning "other" or "different" and the suffix "-τρίωτος" (-triotos) which denotes the state of being or having a certain quality.

Grammar: "αλλοτρίωτος" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. It can also be declined to match the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies.

Description: "αλλοτρίωτος" is used to describe something or someone that is foreign or alien to a particular group or culture. It can also be used to describe something that is strange or unfamiliar.
