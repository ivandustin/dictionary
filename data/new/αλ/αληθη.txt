I'm sorry, but the word "αληθη" is not a valid Greek word. It seems to be a misspelling of the Greek word "αλήθεια" (alithia), which means "truth". 

Etymology: The word "αλήθεια" comes from the ancient Greek word "ἀλήθεια" (aletheia), which means "truth" or "reality". It is derived from the prefix "a-" (not) and the verb "λανθάνω" (lanthano), which means "to hide" or "to escape notice". Therefore, "αλήθεια" literally means "not hidden" or "not concealed".

Grammar: "αλήθεια" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "αλήθειες" (alitheies).

Description: "αλήθεια" is a fundamental concept in philosophy, science, and everyday life. It refers to the state or quality of being in accordance with fact or reality, as opposed to falsehood or illusion. In Greek mythology, "αλήθεια" was personified as a goddess who was one of the daughters of Zeus.
