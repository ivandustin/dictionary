Word: ψευδαπόστολοι

Etymology: The word ψευδαπόστολοι comes from the Greek words ψευδής (pseudēs) meaning false and ἀπόστολος (apostolos) meaning apostle. Therefore, the word ψευδαπόστολοι means false apostles.

Grammar: ψευδαπόστολοι is a plural noun in Greek. In English, it can be translated as false apostles.

Description: In the New Testament, the term ψευδαπόστολοι is used to describe people who claimed to be apostles of Christ but were not. These false apostles were often seen as a threat to the early Christian communities, as they spread false teachings and caused confusion among the believers. The Apostle Paul warned the Corinthians about false apostles, saying that they were deceitful workers who disguised themselves as apostles of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:13).
