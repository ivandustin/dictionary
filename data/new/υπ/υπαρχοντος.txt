Word: υπαρχοντος

Etymology:
The word υπαρχοντος comes from the Greek verb υπάρχω (ypárcho), which means "to exist" or "to be present". The word is derived from the combination of the prefix υπο- (ypo-), meaning "under" or "beneath", and the verb άρχω (árcho), meaning "to begin" or "to rule".

Grammar:
υπαρχοντος is the genitive singular form of the Greek noun υπάρχων (ypárchon), which means "existing" or "present". In Greek grammar, the genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and is often translated into English as "of" or "'s". Therefore, υπαρχοντος can be translated as "of the existing" or "of the present".
