Word: υπεραιρομενος

Etymology:
The word υπεραιρομενος comes from the Greek verb υπεραίρω (hyperairō), which means "to lift up" or "to raise up". The suffix -μενος (-menos) is a participle ending that indicates the action is ongoing or continuous. Therefore, υπεραιρομενος can be translated as "being lifted up" or "being raised up".

Grammar:
υπεραιρομενος is a present participle in the passive voice. In Greek, participles are verbal adjectives that can be used to modify nouns or act as verbs in their own right. The present participle indicates that the action is ongoing or continuous, and the passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:
υπεραιρομενος can be used to describe a person or object that is being lifted up or raised up. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a person who is being elevated in status or position. For example, one might say "Ο πρόεδρος είναι υπεραιρομενος στην κοινωνία" (The president is elevated in society).
