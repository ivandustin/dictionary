Word: υπερεπερισσευσεν

Etymology: The word υπερεπερισσευσεν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of three words: υπέρ (huper), επί (epi), and περισσεύω (perisseuo). υπέρ means "above" or "beyond," επί means "on" or "upon," and περισσεύω means "to be in excess" or "to abound." Therefore, the word υπερεπερισσευσεν means "he/she/it abounded exceedingly" or "he/she/it was in excess to an extreme degree."

Grammar: υπερεπερισσευσεν is a verb in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. It is in the third person singular form, which means that it refers to a singular subject (he/she/it). The verb is also in the active voice, which means that the subject is performing the action.

Description: υπερεπερισσευσεν is a very rare and unusual word in Greek, and it is only found once in the New Testament (Ephesians 1:8). The word is used to describe the abundance of God's grace towards us, and it emphasizes the idea that God's grace is not just abundant, but it is in excess to an extreme degree. The word conveys a sense of overflowing abundance that cannot be contained or measured.
