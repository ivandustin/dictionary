I'm sorry, but the word "υπερβοληι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "υπερβολή" (hyperbole), which means an exaggerated statement or claim not meant to be taken literally. 

Etymology: The word "υπερβολή" comes from the Greek roots "υπέρ" (over, above) and "βάλλω" (to throw), meaning to throw beyond or exceed.

Grammar: "Υπερβολή" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined as such. Its plural form is "υπερβολές".

Description: Hyperbole is a common literary device used in both ancient and modern Greek literature. It is often used for emphasis or to create a humorous effect.
