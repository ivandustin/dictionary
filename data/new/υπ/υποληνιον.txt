Word: υποληνιον

Etymology:
The word υποληνιον (ypolinion) is a Greek word that comes from the combination of two words: υπο (ypo) meaning "under" and ληνος (lenos) meaning "a wine-press". Therefore, the word υποληνιον refers to a place or a container where the juice of grapes is collected after being pressed.

Grammar:
In Greek, υποληνιον is a neuter noun of the second declension. Its nominative singular form is υποληνιον, and its genitive singular form is υποληνιου. The word can also be declined in the plural form, which is υποληνια.

Description:
υποληνιον is a term used in ancient Greek literature to describe a container or a place where the juice of grapes is collected after being pressed. It was commonly used in the process of winemaking, which was an important industry in ancient Greece. The juice collected in the υποληνιον was then transferred to amphorae for storage and transportation. Today, the word is rarely used in modern Greek, as the process of winemaking has evolved and modern equipment is used instead.
