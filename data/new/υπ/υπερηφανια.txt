Word: υπερηφανία

Etymology:
The word υπερηφανία (yperifanía) comes from the combination of two Greek words: υπέρ (yper), meaning "above" or "beyond," and ηφανία (ifanía), meaning "pride" or "arrogance." Therefore, the literal translation of υπερηφανία is "excessive pride" or "overwhelming arrogance."

Grammar:
In Greek, υπερηφανία is a feminine noun, and its article is η (i). It is declined in the same way as other feminine nouns ending in -ία (-ia). For example:

- Singular: η υπερηφανία (i yperifanía) - the pride/arrogance
- Plural: οι υπερηφανίες (i yperifaníes) - the prides/arrogances

Description:
υπερηφανία is a complex emotion that can be both positive and negative. On the one hand, it can be a healthy sense of self-respect and confidence in one's abilities and accomplishments. On the other hand, it can also be an excessive and unhealthy form of pride that leads to arrogance, narcissism, and a lack of empathy for others.

In Greek culture, υπερηφανία is often associated with the concept of φιλότιμο (filótimo), which is a deep sense of honor, dignity, and respect for oneself and others. However, when υπερηφανία becomes excessive, it can lead to negative consequences, such as conflicts, misunderstandings, and social isolation.

Overall, υπερηφανία is a complex and multifaceted emotion that requires careful consideration and balance in order to be expressed in a healthy and positive way.
