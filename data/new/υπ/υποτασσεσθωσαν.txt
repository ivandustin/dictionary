Word: υποτασσεσθωσαν

Etymology: This word is a conjugated form of the Greek verb "υποτάσσω" (hypotássō), which means "to submit" or "to subordinate". It is derived from the prefix "υπο-" (hypo-), meaning "under", and the verb "τάσσω" (tássō), meaning "to arrange" or "to put in order".

Grammar: υποτασσεσθωσαν is the third person plural aorist passive subjunctive form of the verb υποτάσσω. In Greek, the subjunctive mood is used to express doubt, possibility, or hypothetical situations. The aorist tense refers to a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject receives the action of the verb.

Description: υποτασσεσθωσαν can be translated as "let them be subjected" or "let them be subordinated". It is a command or request for someone to submit or be placed under the authority of another. The use of the subjunctive mood suggests that this is a hypothetical or uncertain situation.
