Word: κεκρικατε

Etymology: The word κεκρικατε is a conjugated form of the Greek verb κρικάω (krikáo), which means "to creak" or "to make a noise". The prefix κεκρι- (kekri-) indicates that the action is in the perfect tense, meaning it has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Grammar: κεκρικατε is the second person plural form of the perfect indicative active of κρικάω. It is formed by adding the prefix κεκρι- to the stem κρικα- and the ending -τε. This form indicates that the action of creaking has been completed by a group of people in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Description: κεκρικατε can be translated as "you all have creaked" or "you all have made a noise". It is a relatively uncommon word in modern Greek, but it can be found in literature and poetry. The word can be used to describe the sound of a door or a floorboard creaking, or any other similar noise.
