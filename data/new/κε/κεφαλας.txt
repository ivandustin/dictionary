The word "κεφαλας" (kephalas) is a Greek noun that means "head" or "skull". It is derived from the Greek word "κεφαλή" (kephalē), which also means "head". In terms of grammar, "κεφαλας" is in the genitive case, which is used to indicate possession or relationship. 

In Greek mythology, the Gorgon Medusa was said to have snakes for hair and a head that could turn people to stone. Her head was eventually severed by the hero Perseus, who used it as a weapon against his enemies. The term "Medusa's head" is often used to refer to a symbol of danger or warning. 

In modern Greek, "κεφαλας" is still used to mean "head" or "skull", and can also be used in idiomatic expressions such as "κρατάω το κεφάλι ψηλά" (kratáo to kefáli psilá), which means "to keep one's head up" or "to stay positive".
