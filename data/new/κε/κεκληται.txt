Word: κεκληται

Etymology:
The word κεκληται is a perfect passive indicative form of the Greek verb καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call" or "to summon". The root of the word is κλη- (kle-), which means "to call" or "to name". The prefix κε- (ke-) indicates the perfect tense, which refers to an action that has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Grammar:
κεκληται is a third-person singular form of the perfect passive indicative tense in Greek. This form indicates that the action of calling or summoning has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The word is also in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action.

Description:
κεκληται can be translated as "he/she/it has been called" or "he/she/it has been summoned". The word is often used in legal or official contexts to indicate that someone has been summoned to appear in court or to perform a duty. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe those who have been called by God to be his followers.
