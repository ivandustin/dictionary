Description:
κειρασθω is a command or request for someone to be cut or sheared. It is often used in the context of cutting hair or shearing wool from sheep. In ancient Greece, hair was considered a symbol of strength and virility, and cutting one's hair was often seen as a sign of submission or mourning. Shearing sheep was an important economic activity, as wool was a valuable commodity used for clothing and other textiles. Today, the word κειρασθω is still used in modern Greek to refer to cutting hair or shearing sheep, but it can also be used more broadly to mean "to cut" or "to trim".
