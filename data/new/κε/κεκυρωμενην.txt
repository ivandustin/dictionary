Word: κεκυρωμενην

Etymology: κεκυρωμενην is the feminine singular form of the Greek verb κυρόω (kyroo), which means "to confirm, ratify, establish." The prefix κε- (ke-) indicates that the verb is in the perfect tense, which means that the action has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Grammar: κεκυρωμενην is a participle in the perfect passive voice, which means that the action of the verb has been completed in the past and the subject of the verb (in this case, a feminine singular noun) is the recipient of the action. The participle form is often used to modify a noun or pronoun, and can function as an adjective or adverb in a sentence.

Description: κεκυρωμενην can be translated as "having been confirmed" or "having been ratified." It is often used in legal or official contexts to indicate that a decision or agreement has been formally approved and is now in effect. In Greek literature, it can also be used metaphorically to describe something that has been firmly established or settled.
