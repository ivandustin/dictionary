Word: κεκενωται

Etymology: The word κεκενωται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κενός (kenos), which means "empty" or "void". The verb form κεκενωται is in the perfect tense, indicating a completed action with ongoing effects.

Grammar: κεκενωται is a third-person singular verb in the perfect tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. It is conjugated from the verb κενόω (kenoo), which means "to empty" or "to make void". The perfect tense indicates that the action has been completed in the past with ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon, rather than performing the action. The indicative mood indicates a statement of fact or reality.

Description: κεκενωται can be translated to mean "has been emptied" or "has been made void". It is often used in a spiritual or metaphorical sense, such as in the New Testament of the Bible where it is used to describe the emptying of oneself to become more like Christ (Philippians 2:7). In a more literal sense, it can be used to describe a container that has been emptied of its contents.
