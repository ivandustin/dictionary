I'm sorry, but the word "γραφηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "γραφή" (graphi), which means "writing" or "scripture". 

Etymology: The word "γραφή" comes from the Greek verb "γράφω" (grapho), which means "to write". 

Grammar: "γραφή" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "γραφή" can refer to any type of writing, including literature, documents, or inscriptions. It can also refer specifically to the writings of the Bible or other religious texts.
