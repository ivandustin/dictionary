Word: ενεκαινισεν

Etymology:
The word ενεκαινισεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word καινός (kainos), which means "new" or "fresh." The prefix εν- (en-) means "in" or "into," so the word ενεκαινισεν can be translated as "made new" or "renewed."

Grammar:
ενεκαινισεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. It is derived from the verb καινίζω (kainizo), which means "to make new" or "to renew." The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (he, she, or it) performed the action.

Description:
ενεκαινισεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the act of renewing or restoring something to its original state. It is often used in reference to the renewal of the human spirit or the transformation of the mind. In Ephesians 4:23, for example, the word is used to describe the process of being "renewed in the spirit of your mind." The word emphasizes the idea of making something new again, rather than simply repairing or fixing it.
