Word: ενγεγραπται

Etymology: The word ενγεγραπται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γράφω (grapho), which means "to write." The prefix εν (en) means "in" or "on," so ενγεγραπται can be translated as "it has been written in/on."

Grammar: ενγεγραπται is a third-person singular perfect passive indicative verb in Greek. This means that it describes an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, it) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: ενγεγραπται can be translated as "it has been written in/on." This verb is often used in legal or official contexts to indicate that something has been recorded or registered. It can also be used more generally to describe something that has been written down or inscribed.
