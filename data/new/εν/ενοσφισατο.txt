Word: ενοσφισατο

Etymology:
The word ενοσφισατο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "οσφίζομαι" (osfizomai), which means "to press tightly" or "to squeeze". The prefix "εν" (en) in this word means "in" or "into", so ενοσφισατο can be translated as "he squeezed into" or "he pressed tightly into".

Grammar:
ενοσφισατο is a third-person singular aorist middle indicative verb in ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is acting upon himself or herself. In this case, the subject is the Greek hero Odysseus, who is described as having squeezed himself tightly into a narrow passage in the epic poem The Odyssey.

Description:
The word ενοσφισατο is used in The Odyssey to describe Odysseus' clever escape from the Cyclops Polyphemus. After blinding the Cyclops, Odysseus and his men hide under the bellies of the sheep as they are let out of the cave. However, Polyphemus feels the backs of the sheep as they pass and realizes that something is amiss. Odysseus then comes up with the plan to tie his men to the undersides of the sheep, so that they can escape undetected. In order to fit into the narrow passage leading out of the cave, Odysseus "squeezed himself tightly" or ενοσφισατο. This word emphasizes the physical difficulty of the escape and the bravery and resourcefulness of Odysseus.
