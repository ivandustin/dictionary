Word: ενεκαλουν

Etymology:
The word ενεκαλουν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word ἐκάλεσα (ekalesa), which means "I called." The prefix εν- (en-) means "in" or "into," so ενεκαλουν can be translated as "they called in" or "they summoned."

Grammar:
ενεκαλουν is a third-person plural imperfect active indicative verb in ancient Greek. It is conjugated from the root word ἐκάλεσα (ekalesa) and the prefix εν- (en-). The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, and the active voice means that the subject is performing the action.

Description:

It is used to describe the action of Martha and Mary, the sisters of Lazarus, who sent word to Jesus that their brother was sick. The verb emphasizes the urgency and importance of their message, as they were calling Jesus to come and heal their brother.
