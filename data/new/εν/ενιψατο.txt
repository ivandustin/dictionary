Word: ενιψατο

Etymology: ενιψατο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word νίπτω (nípto), which means "to wash." The prefix εν- (en-) adds the meaning of "in" or "into," so ενιψατο means "he/she/it washed himself/herself/itself."

Grammar: ενιψατο is a third-person singular aorist middle-passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, the subject is the reflexive pronoun "himself/herself/itself," indicating that the action of washing was done to oneself.

Description: ενιψατο is a verb that describes the act of washing oneself. It can be used in a literal sense, such as washing one's body or hands, or in a figurative sense, such as washing away guilt or sin. The word is commonly used in religious contexts, particularly in the Greek Orthodox Church, where it is used to describe the act of baptism.
