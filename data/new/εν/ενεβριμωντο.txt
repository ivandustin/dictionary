Word: ενεβριμωντο

Etymology: The word ενεβριμωντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word βριμάομαι (brimáomai), which means "to snort with anger" or "to be indignant." The prefix εν- (en-) adds the meaning of "in" or "into," so ενεβριμωντο can be translated as "they were snorting with anger" or "they were becoming indignant."

Grammar: ενεβριμωντο is a third-person plural imperfect middle-passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, while the middle-passive voice suggests that the subject is both performing and receiving the action. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it could be translated as "they were being snorted at with anger" or "they were being made indignant."

Description: ενεβριμωντο is a strong verb that conveys a sense of intense emotion. It is often used in the New Testament to describe the reactions of people to Jesus' teachings or actions. For example, in Mark 10:14, the disciples ενεβριμωντο (were indignant) when people brought children to Jesus to be blessed. In John 11:33, Jesus ενεβριμωντο (was deeply moved) when he saw Mary weeping over the death of her brother Lazarus. Overall, ενεβριμωντο is a powerful word that captures the passion and intensity of human emotion.
