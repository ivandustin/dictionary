The word "ενεστωτα" (enestota) is a Greek term that refers to the present tense in grammar. It is derived from the Greek word "ενεστώς" (enestos), which means "present" or "existing." 

In terms of grammar, the present tense is used to describe actions or events that are currently happening or ongoing. For example, in the sentence "I am writing this definition," the verb "writing" is in the present tense. 

The present tense can also be used to describe habitual actions or general truths. For example, in the sentence "The sun rises in the east," the verb "rises" is in the present tense, even though it is a general truth that applies to all times. 

Overall, the present tense is an important aspect of Greek grammar and is used in a variety of contexts to describe ongoing actions, habitual actions, and general truths.
