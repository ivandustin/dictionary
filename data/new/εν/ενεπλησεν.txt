Word: ενεπλησεν

Etymology: ενεπλησεν is a Greek word that comes from the verb πληρόω (plēróō), which means "to fill" or "to complete". The prefix εν- (en-) means "in" or "into", so ενεπλησεν can be translated as "he filled in" or "he completed".

Grammar: ενεπλησεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb πληρόω (plēróō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. The indicative mood indicates that the action is a statement of fact, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description: ενεπλησεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Luke 1:53. The verse reads: "He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty." In this context, ενεπλησεν is used to describe God's action of filling the hungry with good things. The word conveys a sense of completion and satisfaction, as if the hunger has been completely satisfied.
