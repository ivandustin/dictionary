Word: ενεδιδυσκετο

Etymology: The word ενεδιδυσκετο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb ενδιδύσκω (endidysko), which means "to put on" or "to dress oneself". The verb is derived from the prefix εν- (en-), which means "in" or "into", and the verb δύνω (dyno), which means "to be able to". Therefore, the etymology of ενεδιδυσκετο can be traced back to the Proto-Indo-European root *deh₁- (to put on, dress).
