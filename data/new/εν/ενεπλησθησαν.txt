Word: ενεπλησθησαν

Etymology: The word ενεπλησθησαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πληρόω (plēróō), which means "to fill." The prefix εν- (en-) means "in" or "into," so ενεπλησθησαν can be translated as "they were filled in."

Grammar: ενεπλησθησαν is a third-person plural aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. In English, this means that it is a verb that describes an action that happened in the past, was done to the subject (they), and was completed. The passive voice indicates that the subject received the action rather than performed it.

Description: ενεπλησθησαν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Luke 2:40, to describe how Jesus grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. The verb emphasizes the idea that Jesus was completely filled with these qualities, leaving no room for anything else.
