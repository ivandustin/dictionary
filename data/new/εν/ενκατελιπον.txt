The word ενκατελιπον is a Greek word that is derived from the combination of two words: εν (en) meaning "in" or "within" and καταλείπω (kataleipo) meaning "to leave behind" or "to abandon". Therefore, the word ενκατελιπον can be translated to mean "left behind" or "abandoned within".

Grammar:

Description:
The word ενκατελιπον is used in the New Testament of the Bible in the book of Matthew 19:27. In this passage, Peter says to Jesus, "Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?" Jesus responds by saying, "Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last first." 

Therefore, the word ενκατελιπον is used to describe the act of leaving behind or abandoning something or someone for the sake of following Jesus and receiving eternal life.
