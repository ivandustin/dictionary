Word: ενετειλατο

Etymology:
The word ενετειλατο comes from the Greek verb εντέλλομαι (entéllomai), which means "to order" or "to command". The prefix εν- (en-) means "in" or "on", and the root τέλος (télos) means "goal" or "end". Therefore, εντέλλομαι originally meant "to give an order towards a goal".

Grammar:
ενετειλατο is a third-person singular aorist middle deponent verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. The deponent form means that the verb is passive in form but active in meaning. Therefore, ενετειλατο can be translated as "he/she/it ordered for himself/herself/itself".

Description:

The word can be used in various contexts, such as military orders, instructions from a superior, or personal decisions.
