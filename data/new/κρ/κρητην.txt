Sorry, I cannot define the word "κρητην" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the Greek word "Κρήτην" which means "Crete" in English. 

Etymology: The word "Κρήτην" comes from the Greek word "Κρήτη" which is the name of the largest Greek island in the Mediterranean Sea. 

Grammar: "Κρήτην" is the accusative case of the noun "Κρήτη". 

Description: "Κρήτην" refers to the island of Crete in Greece. It is known for its rich history, beautiful beaches, and unique culture.
