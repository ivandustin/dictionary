I'm sorry, but the word "κρεα" is not a complete word in Greek. It seems to be a fragment or a misspelling of the word "κρέας" (kreas), which means "meat" in English. 

Etymology: The word "κρέας" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *krew-, which means "raw flesh" or "meat". It is related to the Latin word "caro" and the English word "carnivore".

Grammar: "Κρέας" is a neuter noun in Greek, and its nominative singular form is "κρέας". In the plural, it becomes "κρέατα" (kreat-a).

Description: "Κρέας" is a common food item in Greek cuisine, and it can refer to various types of meat, such as beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. It is often used in dishes like souvlaki, gyros, and moussaka.
