Word: κριναντες

Etymology: κριναντες is the aorist participle of the Greek verb κρίνω (krinó), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The word comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *krei-, which means "to separate" or "to distinguish".

Grammar: κριναντες is a masculine nominative plural aorist participle in Ancient Greek. It is derived from the verb κρίνω and indicates that the subject of the sentence (which is not explicitly stated) judged or decided something in the past.

Description: κριναντες can be translated as "having judged" or "having decided". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the actions of judges or those who make decisions. For example, in Matthew 7:1, Jesus says "Do not judge, or you too will be judged" (μὴ κρίνετε, ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε). The participle κριναντες is used here to describe those who judge others.
