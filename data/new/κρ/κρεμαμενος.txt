Word: κρεμαμένος

Etymology:
The word κρεμαμένος (kremaménos) is a Greek adjective that comes from the verb κρεμάω (kremáo), which means "to hang". The suffix -μένος (-ménos) is a participle ending that indicates a state or condition. Therefore, κρεμαμένος means "hanging" or "suspended".

Grammar:
In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, κρεμαμένος changes its form depending on the gender, number, and case of the noun it describes. For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, it becomes κρεμαμένος. If it modifies a feminine singular noun in the nominative case, it becomes κρεμαμένη. If it modifies a neuter plural noun in the accusative case, it becomes κρεμαμένα.

Description:
κρεμαμένος is an adjective that describes something that is hanging or suspended. It can be used to describe a person, an object, or an animal that is hanging from a rope, a branch, or any other support. For example, κρεμαμένος can be used to describe a picture hanging on a wall, a piece of meat hanging in a butcher shop, or a person hanging from a cliff. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe a situation or a feeling that is unresolved or uncertain, as in "κρεμαμένος έμεινε ο λόγος" (the matter remained unresolved).
