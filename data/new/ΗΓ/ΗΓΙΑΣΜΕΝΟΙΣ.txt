Etymology: The word "ηγιασμένοις" comes from the Greek verb "ηγιάζω" (igiázo), which means "to sanctify" or "to make holy." The suffix "-μένοις" (-menois) is added to the verb stem to indicate the passive voice and the dative case, resulting in the meaning "to the sanctified ones" or "for the holy ones."

Grammar: "Ηγιασμένοις" is the dative plural form of the adjective "ηγιασμένος" (igiásmenos), which means "sanctified" or "holy." In Greek grammar, the dative case is used to indicate the indirect object or the recipient of an action.

Description: "Ηγιασμένοις" is used to refer to a group of people who have been sanctified or made holy. It can be used to describe individuals who have been consecrated or set apart for a sacred purpose, such as priests, monks, or religious devotees. It can also be used in a more general sense to refer to people who are considered morally pure or spiritually elevated.
