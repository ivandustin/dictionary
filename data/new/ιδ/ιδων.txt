Etymology:
The word ιδων (idōn) is a form of the Greek verb εἶδον (eidon), which means "I saw" or "I have seen". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *weyd- which means "to see".

Grammar:
Ιδων is the aorist participle of the verb εἶδον (eidon), which means "having seen" or "having looked at". It is declined like a regular adjective in the masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. The stem of the participle is ιδοντ- (idont-), and the ending is -ας (-as).

Description:
Ιδων is used in Greek literature to describe someone who has seen or looked at something. It is often used in the context of a vision or a revelation. For example, in the Iliad, Homer uses the word ιδων to describe the vision that Achilles has of his own death. The word can also be used in a more literal sense, to describe someone who has seen something with their own eyes.
