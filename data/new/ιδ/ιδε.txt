Word: ιδε

Etymology:
The word ιδε (ide) comes from the Greek verb εἶδον (eidon), which means "to see" or "to perceive." It is related to the English word "idea," which also comes from the Greek word εἶδος (eidos), meaning "form" or "appearance."

Grammar:
Ιδε is a verb in the imperative mood, which is used to give commands or make requests. It is the second person singular form of the verb, meaning "you see" or "look."

Description:
Ιδε is a simple and direct command to look or see something. It is often used in the Bible as a command from God to his followers, such as in the phrase "Behold, I am with you always" (Matthew 28:20). In modern Greek, it is still used as a command to draw someone's attention to something, similar to the English phrase "look here."
