Word: κυριος

Etymology:
The word κυριος (kyrios) is a Greek word that means "lord" or "master". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *keuə-, which means "to swell" or "to be strong". The word has been used in Greek literature since ancient times and has been adopted into many other languages, including English.

Grammar:
In Greek, κυριος is a masculine noun that is declined in the nominative case as κυριος. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive case κυριου (kyriou) and the accusative case κυριον (kyrion). The word can be used as a subject, object, or possessive noun in a sentence.

Description:
The word κυριος is often used in Greek literature and religious texts to refer to God or a deity. It can also be used to refer to a human lord or master, such as a ruler or a landowner. In modern Greek, the word is often used as a title of respect, similar to "sir" or "mister" in English.
