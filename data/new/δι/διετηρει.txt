Etymology:
διετηρει is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: διά (diá), which means "through" or "across," and τηρέω (tēréō), which means "to keep" or "to guard." Therefore, διετηρει can be translated as "to keep through" or "to guard across."

Grammar:

The verb stem is τηρει (tērei), and the prefix διά (diá) adds the meaning of "through" or "across."
