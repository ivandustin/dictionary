I'm sorry, but the word "διακονηι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of "διακονία" (diakonia), which means "service" or "ministry" in English. 

Etymology: The word "διακονία" comes from the Greek verb "διακονέω" (diakoneo), which means "to serve" or "to minister." 

Grammar: "Διακονία" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined as follows: 

Singular: η διακονία (i diakonia) 
Plural: οι διακονίες (oi diakonies) 

Description: "Διακονία" is a term used in the New Testament to refer to the service or ministry of Jesus Christ and his followers. It is also used in the context of the early Christian church to describe the work of deacons, who were responsible for serving the needs of the community. Today, the term is still used in Christian contexts to refer to various forms of service and ministry.
