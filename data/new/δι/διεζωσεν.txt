Word: διεζωσεν

Etymology: διεζωσεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word ζωννυμι (zonnymi), which means "to gird" or "to fasten with a belt." The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "completely" or "thoroughly," so διεζωσεν can be translated as "he completely girded" or "he thoroughly fastened with a belt."

Grammar: διεζωσεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (he) performed the action. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description: διεζωσεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible in Luke 12:35, where it describes the action of a master who is preparing his servants for his return. The master tells his servants to be dressed and ready, with their lamps burning, and to be like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding feast. The master then says, "Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them" (Luke 12:37, ESV). The verb διεζωσεν is used to describe the master's action of completely girding himself for service, which emphasizes his readiness and preparedness to serve his faithful servants.
