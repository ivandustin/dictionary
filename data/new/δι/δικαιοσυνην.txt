Sorry, I cannot define the word "δικαιοσυνην" as it is not a valid Greek word. The correct spelling is "δικαιοσύνη" which means "justice" in English. 

Etymology: The word "δικαιοσύνη" comes from the Greek words "δίκη" (dike) meaning "judgment" or "trial" and "σύνη" (sune) meaning "together" or "with". 

Grammar: "Δικαιοσύνη" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined like other nouns in the first declension. 

Description: "Δικαιοσύνη" refers to the concept of moral and legal righteousness, fairness, and equity. It is a fundamental value in many societies and is often associated with the rule of law and the administration of justice.
