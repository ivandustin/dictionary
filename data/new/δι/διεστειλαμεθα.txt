Word: διεστειλαμεθα

Etymology:
The word διεστειλαμεθα is a Greek verb that comes from the root word στέλλω (stello), which means "to send" or "to order." The prefix δι- (di-) in this word means "through" or "across," and the suffix -μεθα (-meta) indicates that the verb is in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Grammar:
διεστειλαμεθα is a first-person plural verb in the aorist tense. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, and the -μεθα (-meta) ending indicates that the verb is in the past tense.

Description:
The word διεστειλαμεθα can be translated to mean "we ordered ourselves to withdraw" or "we commanded ourselves to retreat." This word is often used in military contexts to describe a strategic retreat or withdrawal. The middle voice in this verb emphasizes that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, indicating that the retreat was a deliberate and voluntary decision made by the group.
