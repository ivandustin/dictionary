Word: διεσκορπισθησαν

Etymology: διεσκορπισθησαν is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix δι- (meaning "apart" or "through") and the verb σκορπίζω (meaning "scatter" or "disperse"). 

Grammar: διεσκορπισθησαν is the third person plural aorist passive indicative form of the verb διασκορπίζω, which means "to scatter" or "to disperse". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb. 

Description: διεσκορπισθησαν describes a group of people or things being scattered or dispersed. It implies that the scattering was done to them, rather than them doing the scattering themselves. The word can be used in a literal sense, such as a group of people being scattered by a strong wind, or in a figurative sense, such as a group of protesters being dispersed by police.
