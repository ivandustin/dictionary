I'm sorry, but the word "διερμηνευηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "διερμηνευτής" (di-er-mi-nee-FTIS), which means "interpreter" or "translator". 

Etymology: The word is derived from the Greek verb "διερμηνεύω" (di-er-mi-nee-VO), which means "to interpret" or "to translate". 

Grammar: "Διερμηνευτής" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. Its plural form is "διερμηνεῖς" (di-er-mi-NEES). 

Description: A "διερμηνευτής" is a person who translates or interprets from one language to another. They may work in various settings, such as in international organizations, government agencies, or private companies. They need to have a strong command of both the source and target languages, as well as cultural knowledge and sensitivity.
