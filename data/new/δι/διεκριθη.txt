Word: διεκριθη

Etymology:
The word διεκριθη comes from the Greek verb διακρίνω (diakrino), which means "to distinguish" or "to separate". It is derived from the prefix δια- (dia-), meaning "through" or "across", and the verb κρίνω (krino), meaning "to judge" or "to decide".

Grammar:
διεκριθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb διακρίνω (diakrino). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:
διεκριθη can be translated as "was distinguished" or "was separated". It is often used in a figurative sense to describe a clear distinction or separation between two things or concepts. For example, in the New Testament, the word is used to describe the separation between believers and non-believers, or between the righteous and the unrighteous.
