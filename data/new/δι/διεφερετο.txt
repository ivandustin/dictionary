Word: διεφερετο

Etymology:
διεφερετο is a Greek word that comes from the verb διαφέρω (diapherō), which means "to differ" or "to be different". The prefix δια- (dia-) means "through" or "across", and the root φέρω (pherō) means "to carry" or "to bear". Therefore, διαφέρω (diapherō) literally means "to carry through" or "to bear across", which can be interpreted as "to distinguish" or "to make a difference".

Grammar:
διεφερετο is the third person singular, imperfect indicative, middle voice form of the verb διαφέρω (diapherō). In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the person, number, tense, voice, and mood. The third person singular refers to a single subject, the imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, and the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description:
διεφερετο can be translated as "he/she/it was distinguishing" or "he/she/it was making a difference". The middle voice suggests that the subject was actively involved in the action of distinguishing or making a difference, rather than just passively receiving it. The imperfect tense indicates that this action was ongoing or repeated in the past, without specifying when it started or ended. Therefore, the meaning of διεφερετο depends on the context in which it is used. It could refer to a person who was distinguishing himself/herself from others, or to a situation where a difference was being made between two things.
