Word: διελεξατο

Etymology:
διελεξατο is a Greek verb that comes from the root words δια- (dia-, meaning "through" or "across") and λεγω (lego, meaning "to speak" or "to say"). The verb form διελεξατο is in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past.

Grammar:
διελεξατο is a third-person singular verb in the aorist tense. It is in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action. In this case, the subject is not specified, so it could refer to any third-person singular subject.

Description:
διελεξατο means "he/she/it discussed" or "he/she/it debated" in English. It implies a conversation or debate between two or more parties, and suggests a back-and-forth exchange of ideas or arguments. The aorist tense indicates that the discussion or debate was completed in the past, and does not provide any information about the duration or outcome of the conversation.
