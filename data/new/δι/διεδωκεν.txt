Word: διεδωκεν

Etymology:
The word διεδωκεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word διώκω (diókō), which means "to pursue" or "to chase." The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "through" or "thoroughly," so διεδωκεν can be translated as "he pursued thoroughly" or "he chased after relentlessly."

Grammar:
διεδωκεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
διεδωκεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible in several places, including Matthew 10:23, where Jesus tells his disciples to flee from persecution and says, "When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes." The verb διεδωκεν emphasizes the idea of pursuing or chasing after something, in this case, the disciples being pursued by those who would persecute them.
