Word: διεζωσμένος

Etymology: The word διεζωσμένος comes from the Greek verb διαζώννυμι (diazonnumi), which means "to gird around" or "to fasten with a belt". The prefix δια- (dia-) means "through" or "across", while ζώννυμι (zonnumi) means "to gird" or "to fasten with a belt". The word διεζωσμένος is the past participle of this verb, and it means "girded around" or "belted".
