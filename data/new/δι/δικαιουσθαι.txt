Word: δικαιουσθαι

Etymology:
The word δικαιουσθαι comes from the Greek verb δικαιόω (dikaióō), which means "to justify" or "to declare righteous". It is derived from the adjective δίκαιος (díkaios), which means "just" or "righteous".

Grammar:
δικαιουσθαι is a verb in the present passive infinitive form. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, mood, and person. The present tense indicates an ongoing action in the present time, while the passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon. The infinitive form is the basic form of the verb that does not indicate any tense, voice, or mood.

Description:
δικαιουσθαι is a term used in Christian theology to describe the process of being justified or declared righteous before God. It is often associated with the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone, which teaches that a person is justified solely by faith in Jesus Christ, apart from any good works or merit of their own. The concept of δικαιουσθαι is also found in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of the apostle Paul.
