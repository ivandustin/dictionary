The word δικαιωθηις (dikaiōthēis) is a Greek verb that means "to be justified" or "to be made righteous." It is derived from the root word δικαιόω (dikaióō), which means "to declare righteous" or "to vindicate." In grammar, δικαιωθηις is a second person singular aorist passive indicative verb, which means that it refers to a past action that was done to you (the second person singular). 

In Christian theology, the concept of justification is central to the doctrine of salvation. It refers to the act of God declaring a sinner to be righteous on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ. The word δικαιωθηις is used in the New Testament to describe this process of being made righteous through faith in Christ.
