The word διακονειν (diakonein) is a Greek verb that means "to serve" or "to minister." It is derived from the noun διακονος (diakonos), which means "servant" or "minister." In the New Testament, the word is often used to describe the work of deacons in the early Christian church, who were responsible for serving the needs of the community. The verb form can also be used more broadly to describe any act of service or assistance. In terms of grammar, διακονειν is a present active infinitive, meaning that it describes an ongoing action in the present tense.
