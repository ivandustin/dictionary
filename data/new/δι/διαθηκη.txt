Description:
In the New Testament, διαθήκη is used to refer to the covenant between God and humanity. This covenant is seen as a promise of salvation and eternal life for those who believe in Jesus Christ. The concept of the διαθήκη is central to Christian theology and is often referred to as the "New Covenant" to distinguish it from the "Old Covenant" between God and the Israelites in the Hebrew Bible. The word διαθήκη is also used in secular contexts to refer to a will or testament, as in the legal document that arranges for the distribution of property after a person's death.
