Word: διεφημισθη

Etymology:
The word διεφημισθη is a Greek word that comes from the verb διαφημίζω (diaphēmízō), which means "to proclaim, to advertise, to make known publicly". The prefix δια- (dia-) means "through, across, thoroughly", and the root word φημίζω (phēmízō) means "to make known, to declare, to announce". 

Grammar:
διεφημισθη is a passive verb in the aorist tense, third person singular. The aorist tense in Greek is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a whole, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer. 

Description:
διεφημισθη can be translated as "was proclaimed, was advertised, was made known publicly". It implies that something was announced or declared to a wide audience, rather than being kept secret or private. The word can be used in various contexts, such as the proclamation of a new law, the announcement of a public event, or the advertising of a product.
