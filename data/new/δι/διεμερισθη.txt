Word: διεμερισθη

Etymology:
The word διεμερισθη comes from the Greek verb διαιρέω (dihaireo), which means "to divide" or "to separate". The prefix δι- (di-) means "apart" or "through", while the root μερίζω (merizo) means "to divide" or "to distribute". The suffix -θη (-the) indicates that the verb is in the aorist passive tense.

Grammar:
διεμερισθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the Greek verb διαιρέω (dihaireo). The aorist tense indicates that the action of dividing or separating occurred in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (the thing being divided or separated) was acted upon by an external force.
