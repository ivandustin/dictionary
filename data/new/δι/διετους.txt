Word: διετους

Etymology:
The word διετους comes from the Greek words δι- (di-), meaning "two," and ἐτοῦς (etous), meaning "year." Therefore, διετους means "two-year" or "biennial."

Grammar:
In Greek, διετους is an adjective that agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, it would be διετής (dietes). If it modifies a feminine singular noun in the accusative case, it would be διετῆ (dietē).
