The word διεστη (diestē) is a Greek verb that means "to separate" or "to divide." It is derived from the prefix δι- (di-), meaning "apart," and the verb εἶμι (eimi), meaning "to go." In terms of grammar, διεστη is a second aorist active indicative verb, which means it describes a completed action in the past. 

In ancient Greek literature, διεστη is often used to describe physical separation or division, such as the separation of two armies or the division of a piece of land. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a separation of ideas or beliefs. 

Example sentence: Οι αρχαίοι Έλληνες διέστησαν την Αττική από τη Βοιωτία με τον τοίχο των Αθηνών. (The ancient Greeks separated Attica from Boeotia with the wall of Athens.)
