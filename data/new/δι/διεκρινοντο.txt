Word: διεκρινοντο

Etymology:
διεκρινοντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρίνω (krinó), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "apart" or "separate", so διεκρινοντο can be translated as "they were separated" or "they were distinguished".

Grammar:
διεκρινοντο is a third-person plural past tense verb in the middle voice. In Greek, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. The past tense indicates that the action took place in the past.

Description:
διεκρινοντο is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Acts 15:39, where it describes a disagreement between Paul and Barnabas over whether to take John Mark with them on their missionary journey. The verb emphasizes the separation or distinction between the two groups that resulted from the disagreement.
