Word: διαχωριζεσθαι

Etymology: δια- (dia-, prefix meaning "through" or "across") + χωρίζεσθαι (chōrízesthai, "to separate"). The word comes from the Ancient Greek language.

Grammar: διαχωριζεσθαι is a verb in the present passive infinitive form. It is derived from the verb χωρίζω (chōrízō), which means "to separate" or "to divide". The prefix δια- adds the meaning of "through" or "across", so the word διαχωριζεσθαι means "to be separated through" or "to be divided across".

Description: διαχωριζεσθαι refers to the act of being separated or divided across something. It can be used in a physical sense, such as separating two objects or dividing a space, or in a more abstract sense, such as separating ideas or concepts. The word can also be used figuratively to describe a person or group being divided or separated by a particular issue or belief.
