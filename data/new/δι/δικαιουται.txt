Description: δικαιουται is a term used in Christian theology to describe the process of being justified or declared righteous before God. It is a key concept in the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone, which holds that a person is made righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus Christ, and not through any works or merit of their own. The word is also used in legal contexts to describe the process of being acquitted or vindicated in a court of law.
