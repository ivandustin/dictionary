Word: διψυχος

Etymology: The word διψυχος comes from the Greek words δις (dis), meaning "twice," and ψυχή (psyche), meaning "soul." Therefore, διψυχος literally means "having two souls."

Grammar: διψυχος is an adjective in Greek, and it can be declined to match the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, it would be διψυχος. If it modifies a feminine singular noun in the accusative case, it would be διψυχην.

Description: In Greek mythology, the term διψυχος was used to describe a person who had two souls or personalities. This concept was often associated with the god Dionysus, who was known for his wild and unpredictable behavior. In modern usage, the term can be used to describe someone who has conflicting or contradictory personality traits.
