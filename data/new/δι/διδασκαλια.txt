Word: διδασκαλία (didaskalia)

Etymology: The word διδασκαλία comes from the Greek verb διδάσκω (didasko), which means "to teach" or "to instruct." The suffix -ία (-ia) is a common Greek suffix used to form abstract nouns, so διδασκαλία can be translated as "teaching" or "instruction."

Grammar: διδασκαλία is a feminine noun in Greek, and its nominative singular form is διδασκαλία. In the plural, it becomes διδασκαλίες (didaskalies). It is often used with the definite article, so you might see it written as η διδασκαλία (the teaching) or οι διδασκαλίες (the teachings).

Description: διδασκαλία refers to the act of teaching or instruction, and can be used in a variety of contexts. It can refer to formal education, such as teaching in a school or university, or to more informal instruction, such as teaching a skill or trade. It can also refer to the content of what is being taught, such as a particular subject or doctrine. In the New Testament, διδασκαλία is often used to refer to the teachings of Jesus and his disciples.
