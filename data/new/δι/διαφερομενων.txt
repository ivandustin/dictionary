Word: διαφερομενων

Etymology:
διαφερομενων is the present participle of the Greek verb διαφέρω (diapherō), which means "to differ" or "to be different". The word is derived from the prefix δια- (dia-), meaning "through" or "across", and the verb φέρω (pherō), meaning "to carry" or "to bear".

Grammar:
διαφερομενων is a present participle in the genitive case, masculine gender, and plural number. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -μενος (-menos) to the stem of the verb. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and in this case, it indicates that the participle is related to a noun in the genitive case.

διαφερομενων can be translated as "of those who are differing" or "of those who are different". It is often used in Greek to describe a group of people or things that have different characteristics or qualities. In English, it can be translated as "differing", "different", or "diverse".
