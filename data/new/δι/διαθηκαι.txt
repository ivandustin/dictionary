The word "διαθηκαι" (diathēkai) is a plural form of the Greek noun "διαθήκη" (diathēkē), which means "covenant" or "testament". 

Etymology: The word comes from the combination of two Greek words: "dia" meaning "through" or "across", and "tithēmi" meaning "to place" or "to set". Therefore, "diathēkē" literally means "a placing through" or "a setting across".

Grammar: "διαθηκαι" is the nominative plural form of "διαθήκη". In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, etc.). The plural form indicates that there are multiple covenants or testaments being referred to.

Description: In ancient Greek culture, a "diathēkē" was a legal agreement or contract between two parties, often involving property or inheritance. In the New Testament of the Bible, the word is used to refer to the covenants between God and humanity, particularly the Old and New Testaments. The plural form "διαθηκαι" may be used to refer to multiple covenants or testaments within the Bible.
