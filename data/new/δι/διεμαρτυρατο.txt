Word: διεμαρτυρατο

Etymology: διεμαρτυρατο is a Greek word that comes from the verb μαρτυρέω (martureo), which means "to testify" or "to bear witness". The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "thoroughly" or "completely", so διεμαρτυρατο can be translated as "he testified thoroughly" or "he bore witness completely".

Grammar: διεμαρτυρατο is the third person singular aorist middle indicative form of the verb μαρτυρέω (martureo). The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is acting upon himself or herself. In this case, διεμαρτυρατο means "he testified thoroughly to himself" or "he bore witness completely to himself".
