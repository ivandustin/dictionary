I'm sorry, but the word "δικαιωθησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "δικαιωθεί", which is the third person singular form of the verb "δικαιώνω" (dikaióno), meaning "to justify" in English. 

Etymology: The word "δικαιώνω" comes from the Greek root word "δίκαιος" (díkaios), which means "just" or "righteous". 

Grammar: "δικαιωθεί" is a verb in the aorist tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. 

Description: The word "δικαιωθεί" is used to describe the action of being justified or declared righteous. It is often used in a legal or moral context, such as in the phrase "δικαιωθείς ενώπιον του νόμου" (dikaiótheis enópion tou nómou), which means "justified before the law".
