Word: διεκριθητε

Etymology:
The word διεκριθητε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρίνω (krinó), which means "to judge" or "to separate." The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "apart" or "thoroughly," so διεκριθητε can be translated as "you were thoroughly judged" or "you were separated."

Grammar:
διεκριθητε is the second person plural aorist passive indicative form of the verb διακρίνω (diakrinó), which means "to separate" or "to distinguish." In this form, it indicates that the action of being judged or separated was done to the subject (you) in the past.

Description:
διεκριθητε is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in 1 Corinthians 11:29. In this passage, the apostle Paul is admonishing the Corinthian church for their behavior during the Lord's Supper, saying that those who partake of the bread and wine in an unworthy manner "eat and drink judgment (κρίμα, krima) to themselves." He then adds, "For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep" (1 Corinthians 11:30). The word διεκριθητε is used to emphasize the seriousness of the situation and the fact that the Corinthians had been thoroughly judged or separated from the rest of the community because of their behavior.
