Word: διεμένεν (diemenen)

Etymology:
διεμένεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word μένω (meno), which means "to stay" or "to remain". The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "through" or "completely", so διεμένεν can be translated as "to stay completely" or "to remain through".

Grammar:
διεμένεν is a third-person singular verb in the imperfect tense. In Greek, the imperfect tense is used to describe an ongoing or repeated action in the past. The verb is formed by adding the suffix -εν (en) to the stem διεμεν- (diemen-).

Description:
διεμένεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the actions of Jesus and his disciples. It is often translated as "stayed" or "remained". For example, in John 1:32, it is written that the Holy Spirit "remained" on Jesus after his baptism. In John 15:4, Jesus tells his disciples to "remain" in him, using the same verb. The word conveys a sense of steadfastness and continuity.
