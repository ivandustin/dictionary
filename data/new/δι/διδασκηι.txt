I'm sorry, but the word "διδασκηι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "διδασκαλία" (didaskalia), which means "teaching" or "instruction". 

Etymology: The word "διδασκαλία" comes from the Greek verb "διδάσκω" (didasko), which means "to teach". 

Grammar: "Διδασκαλία" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined as follows: 

Singular: η διδασκαλία (i didaskalia) 
Plural: οι διδασκαλίες (oi didaskalies) 

Description: "Διδασκαλία" refers to the act of teaching or the body of knowledge that is taught. It can also refer to a specific teaching or lesson. The word is commonly used in educational contexts, such as in schools or universities.
