The word "διοσκουροις" (dioskourois) is a Greek noun in the dative plural form, which refers to the Dioscuri, the twin brothers Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology. The word is derived from the combination of "Διός" (Dios), meaning "of Zeus," and "κοῦρος" (kouros), meaning "youth" or "boy." The Dioscuri were known as the protectors of sailors and were often depicted riding horses or sailing ships.
