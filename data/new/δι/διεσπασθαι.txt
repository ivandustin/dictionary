Word: διεσπασθαι

Etymology:
διεσπασθαι is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix δι- (meaning "apart" or "through") and the verb σπάω (meaning "to break"). The verb form διεσπασθαι is in the passive voice and means "to be broken apart" or "to be scattered".

Grammar:
διεσπασθαι is a third-person singular passive form of the verb σπάω in the aorist tense. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, mood, and person. The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

It can be used in a literal sense, such as when describing the scattering of a group of people or the breaking apart of an object. It can also be used in a figurative sense, such as when describing the scattering of one's thoughts or emotions. The passive voice of the verb emphasizes that the subject is being acted upon, rather than actively participating in the action.
