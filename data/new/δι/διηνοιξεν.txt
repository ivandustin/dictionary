Word: διηνοιξεν

Etymology: διηνοιξεν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix δι- (meaning "through" or "across") and the verb ανοίγω (meaning "to open"). Therefore, διηνοιξεν means "he/she/it opened completely" or "he/she/it opened through".

Grammar: διηνοιξεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb ανοίγω in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense refers to a completed action in the past, and the indicative mood indicates a statement of fact. The active voice means that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description: διηνοιξεν is a verb that describes the action of opening something completely or through. It can be used in a literal sense, such as opening a door or a window, or in a figurative sense, such as opening one's mind or heart.
