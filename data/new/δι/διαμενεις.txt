Word: διαμένεις

Etymology:
The word διαμένεις comes from the Greek verb διαμένω (diamenō), which is a compound of the prefix δια- (dia-, meaning "through" or "across") and the verb μένω (menō, meaning "to stay" or "to remain"). The prefix δια- emphasizes the idea of permanence or continuity, so διαμένω means "to stay through" or "to remain continuously".

Grammar:
διαμένεις is the second person singular present active indicative form of the verb διαμένω. It is used to describe an action that is currently happening in the present and is being performed by the second person singular subject (you).

Description:
διαμένεις means "you stay" or "you remain" in English. It can be used to describe a physical location where someone is staying or living, or it can be used more figuratively to describe a state of being or a condition that someone is in. For example, someone might say "Διαμένεις στην Αθήνα;" (Diameneis stin Athina?) which means "Do you live in Athens?" or "Διαμένεις ευτυχισμένος;" (Diameneis eftychismenos?) which means "Do you remain happy?"
