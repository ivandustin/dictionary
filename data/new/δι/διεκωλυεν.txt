Word: διεκωλυεν

Etymology:
The word διεκωλυεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κωλύω (kōlýō), which means "to hinder" or "to prevent." The prefix δι- (di-) adds the meaning of "completely" or "thoroughly," so διεκωλυεν can be translated as "completely hindered" or "thoroughly prevented."

Grammar:
διεκωλυεν is a third-person singular verb in the aorist tense. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. The verb is in the indicative mood, which means that it is a statement of fact. The verb is also in the active voice, which means that the subject is performing the action.

Description:
διεκωλυεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Acts 16:6. The verse reads, "And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia." The word διεκωλυεν is translated as "forbidden" in this context, indicating that the Holy Spirit completely prevented or hindered Paul and his companions from speaking the word in Asia. The word carries a sense of strong opposition or resistance, suggesting that the Holy Spirit actively worked to prevent them from going to Asia.
