Description: ους refers to the organ of hearing in humans and animals. It is an important sensory organ that allows us to perceive sound waves and interpret them as meaningful information. The ear is composed of three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. Each part plays a crucial role in the process of hearing. The outer ear collects sound waves and directs them towards the eardrum. The middle ear amplifies the sound waves and transmits them to the inner ear. The inner ear contains the cochlea, which converts the sound waves into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for processing.
