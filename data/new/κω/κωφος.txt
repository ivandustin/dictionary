Description:
κωφός is a word that is used to describe someone who is unable to hear or speak. It can also be used to describe something that is silent or mute. In ancient Greek society, deafness was often seen as a disability, and those who were deaf were often excluded from certain social activities. However, there were also instances where deaf individuals were celebrated for their unique abilities, such as in the case of the famous Greek philosopher Democritus, who was said to have been deaf and communicated through writing. Today, there are many resources and technologies available to help those who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate and participate fully in society.
