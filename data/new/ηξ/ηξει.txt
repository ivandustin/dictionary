The word "ηξει" (pronounced "ixi") is a conjugated form of the Greek verb "έρχομαι" (erchomai), which means "to come". Specifically, "ηξει" is the third person singular future indicative form, meaning "he/she/it will come". 

Etymology: The verb "έρχομαι" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁regʷ- ("to move in a straight line"), which also gave rise to the English words "right" and "direct".
