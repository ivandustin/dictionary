I'm sorry, but the word "αθλησηι" is not a valid Greek word. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "αθληση" (athlisi), which means "sport" or "athletics" in English. 

Etymology: The word "αθληση" comes from the ancient Greek word "αθλος" (athlos), which means "contest" or "competition". 

Grammar: "αθληση" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "αθλήματα" (athlimata). 

Description: "αθληση" refers to any kind of physical activity or sport that involves competition or performance. It can include individual or team sports, such as running, swimming, basketball, soccer, and many others.
