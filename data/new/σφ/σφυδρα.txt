The word "σφυδρα" (sphydra) is a Greek noun that refers to a type of trap or snare used for catching birds or small animals. 

Etymology: The word comes from the Greek verb "σφυρίζω" (sphyrizo), which means "to whistle" or "to make a hissing sound". This is likely because the trap would make a whistling or hissing sound when triggered.

Grammar: "Σφυδρα" is a feminine noun in the singular form.

Description: The sphydra was typically made of a wooden frame with a noose or snare attached to it. The trap would be baited with food, and when an animal or bird entered the trap, it would trigger the snare and become trapped. The sphydra was commonly used in ancient Greece for hunting and trapping small game.
