Description:
In ancient Greece, σφραγίς was used to refer to a seal or stamp used to mark official documents or goods. The seal was often made of wax or clay and would be impressed with a signet ring or other tool. The use of seals was important for ensuring the authenticity and security of important documents and goods.

In the New Testament, σφραγίς is used metaphorically to refer to the seal of the Holy Spirit, which is said to be given to believers as a sign of their salvation and as a guarantee of their inheritance in heaven (Ephesians 1:13-14). The idea of a seal as a mark of ownership or authenticity is also used in other parts of the Bible, such as in the book of Revelation, where the servants of God are said to be sealed with the mark of God on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3-4).
