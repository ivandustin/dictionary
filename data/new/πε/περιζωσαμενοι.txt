Word: περιζωσαμενοι

Etymology: 
The word περιζωσαμενοι is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, passive voice, and participle mood. It is derived from the root word ζώννυμι (zónnumi), which means "to gird" or "to fasten with a belt." The prefix περι- (peri-) means "around" or "about," so the word περιζωσαμενοι can be translated as "having been girded around."

Grammar:
περιζωσαμενοι is a participle, which is a type of verb that functions as an adjective. In this case, it is a passive aorist participle, which means that the action of girding was done to the subject of the sentence. The word is in the masculine gender, plural number, and nominative case, which means that it is describing a group of people who were girded around.

Description:
περιζωσαμενοι is used in the New Testament of the Bible in several places, including Mark 6:9 and Luke 9:3, where it describes the disciples of Jesus being sent out to preach and heal, and being instructed to take nothing with them except a staff and to wear sandals and one tunic, while being girded around with a belt. The word can also be used more generally to describe someone who is prepared or ready for action, as if they have girded themselves for battle or work.
