Etymology:

Grammar:
περιτεμνεσθω is a present passive imperative verb in Greek. It is in the third person singular form and is used to give a command or instruction. The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description:
περιτεμνεσθω is a verb that is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Romans 2:27. In this context, it is used metaphorically to refer to the act of circumcision, which was a significant religious practice in ancient Judaism. The verse reads, "And will not the physically uncircumcised man, if he fulfills the law, judge you who, even with your written code and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law?" Here, περιτεμνεσθω is used to emphasize the importance of following the law, rather than relying solely on physical circumcision.
