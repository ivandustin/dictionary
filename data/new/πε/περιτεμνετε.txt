Word: περιτέμνετε

Etymology: περιτέμνετε is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: περί (peri), which means "around" or "about," and τέμνω (temnō), which means "to cut." Therefore, περιτέμνετε means "to cut around" or "to circumcise."

Grammar: περιτέμνετε is a second-person plural present active indicative verb in Greek. It is conjugated from the verb περιτέμνω (peritemnō), which means "to circumcise." The verb is in the present tense, indicating that the action is happening now. The active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description: περιτέμνετε is a verb that refers to the act of circumcising, which involves cutting off the foreskin of the penis. In ancient times, circumcision was a common practice among Jews and some other cultures, and it was often performed as a religious or cultural rite of passage. Today, circumcision is still practiced in some cultures and religions, but it is not as widespread as it once was. The verb περιτέμνετε is used in the New Testament of the Bible, where it is often used metaphorically to refer to the spiritual act of cutting away sin or unbelief.
