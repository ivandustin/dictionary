Word: περιποίησιν

Etymology:
The word περιποίησιν (peripoí̱isi̱n) is derived from the Greek verb περιποιέω (peripoioéō), which means "to take care of" or "to look after." The suffix -σιν (-sin) is a nominalizing suffix that turns the verb into a noun, giving the word the meaning of "the act of taking care of" or "the act of looking after."

Grammar:
περιποίησιν is a feminine noun in the accusative case. In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The accusative case is used to indicate the direct object of a verb. For example, in the sentence "Ο γιατρός έκανε περιποίηση του τραυματισμένου" (The doctor took care of the injured person), περιποίηση is the direct object of the verb έκανε (took care of).
