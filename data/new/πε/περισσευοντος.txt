Word: περισσευοντος

Etymology: περισσευοντος is a present participle of the Greek verb περισσεύω (perisseuō), which means "to be in excess, to abound, to be left over." The word is derived from the prefix περι- (peri-), meaning "around" or "excessively," and the verb σεύω (seuō), meaning "to pour."

Grammar: περισσευοντος is a masculine singular genitive form of the present participle of the verb περισσεύω. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the stem of the verb. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship to another noun.

Description: περισσευοντος can be translated as "of the one who is in excess" or "of the one who abounds." It is often used in the New Testament to describe the abundance of God's grace or blessings. For example, in Romans 5:17, it is written, "For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!"
