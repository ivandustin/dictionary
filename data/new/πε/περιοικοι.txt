Description:
In ancient Greece, the perioikoi were free inhabitants who lived in the areas surrounding the Spartan city-state. They were not citizens of Sparta, but they were not slaves either. They were allowed to own property and engage in trade, but they were not allowed to participate in politics or the military. The perioikoi played an important role in the economy of Sparta, as they provided goods and services to the city-state. They also served as a buffer zone between Sparta and its enemies, as they were often the first line of defense in times of war.
