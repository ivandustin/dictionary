Description:
περιτεμειν is a Greek verb that means "to circumcise". Circumcision is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the foreskin of the penis. In ancient times, circumcision was a common practice among the Jews and some other cultures, and it was often performed as a religious or cultural rite of passage.
