Word: περιεβλεπετο

Etymology:
The word περιεβλεπετο is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix περι- (meaning "around" or "surrounding") and the verb εβλεπετο (meaning "he/she/it was looking"). The verb εβλεπετο is derived from the root βλεπ-, which means "to see" or "to look".

Grammar:
περιεβλεπετο is a third-person singular, imperfect, middle-passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both performing and receiving the action of the verb. The imperfect tense indicates that the action was ongoing or repeated in the past.

Description:
περιεβλεπετο can be translated as "he/she/it was looking around" or "he/she/it was surveying". The word suggests a deliberate and thorough observation of one's surroundings. It can also imply a sense of caution or vigilance, as if the subject is on the lookout for something specific.
