Word: πετρωδη

Etymology:
The word πετρωδη comes from the Greek word πέτρα (petra) which means "rock" or "stone". The suffix -ωδη (-ode) is used to form adjectives that describe a particular quality or characteristic. Therefore, πετρωδη can be translated as "rocky" or "stony".

Grammar:
πετρωδη is an adjective in the feminine singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, if we want to describe a masculine noun in the singular form, we would use the masculine singular form of the adjective, which is πετρωδης (petrodis).

For example, we could say "Η πετρωδη περιοχή είναι πολύ όμορφη" (The rocky area is very beautiful) or "Η πετρωδη επιδερμίδα του είναι πολύ σκληρή" (His stony skin is very tough).
