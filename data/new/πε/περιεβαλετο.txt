Word: περιεβάλετο

Etymology:
The word περιεβάλετο is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: περί (peri) meaning "around" and ἐβάλλον (eballon) meaning "to throw". The prefix περί (peri) is a common Greek prefix that is used to indicate the idea of "around" or "surrounding". The root word ἐβάλλον (eballon) is the imperfect tense of the Greek verb βάλλω (ballo) meaning "to throw". Therefore, the word περιεβάλετο can be translated as "he/she/it was surrounded" or "he/she/it had been thrown around".

Grammar:
περιεβάλετο is a third-person singular, past tense, middle/passive voice form of the Greek verb περιβάλλω (periballo) which means "to surround" or "to encircle". The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is either performing the action on themselves (middle voice) or receiving the action (passive voice). In this case, the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject was surrounded by something or someone.

Description:

It can be used to describe a physical or metaphorical situation where someone or something is surrounded by a particular environment, circumstance, or group of people. The word can be used in a variety of contexts, such as describing a person who is surrounded by a group of friends, a city that is surrounded by mountains, or a person who is surrounded by problems.
