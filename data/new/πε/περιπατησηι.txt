I'm sorry, but the word "περιπατησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "περιπάτηση" (peripatisi), which means "walking" or "strolling". 

Etymology: The word "περιπάτηση" comes from the verb "περιπατώ" (peripato), which means "to walk around". The prefix "περι-" (peri-) means "around" or "about", and the root "πατ-" (pat-) means "to walk". 

Grammar: "Περιπάτηση" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "περιπατήσεις" (peripatiseis). 

Description: "Περιπάτηση" refers to the act of walking or strolling, usually for leisure or exercise. It can also refer to a specific walk or stroll, such as a walk in the park or a stroll along the beach.
