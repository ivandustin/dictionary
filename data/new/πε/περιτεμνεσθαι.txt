Word: περιτεμνεσθαι

Etymology:
The word περιτεμνεσθαι comes from the Greek verb περιτέμνω (peritémnō), which means "to circumcise." The word is derived from the prefix περι- (peri-), meaning "around," and the verb τέμνω (témnō), meaning "to cut."

Grammar:
περιτεμνεσθαι is a present passive infinitive form of the verb περιτέμνω (peritémnō). In Greek, infinitives are formed by adding the suffix -ειν (-ein) to the stem of the verb. The present tense indicates that the action is happening now, and the passive voice indicates that the subject is receiving the action.

Description:

The verb is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the act of circumcision, particularly in the context of the conversion of Gentiles to Christianity. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe the cutting away of something unwanted or unnecessary.
