Word: περιτεμνησθε

Etymology:
The word περιτεμνησθε is derived from the Greek verb περιτέμνω (peritemnō), which means "to circumcise." The word is formed by adding the reflexive suffix -σθε (-sthe) to the verb stem περιτεμν- (peritemn-).

Grammar:
περιτεμνησθε is a second-person plural present passive imperative verb form in Greek. It is used to give a command or instruction to a group of people, telling them to be circumcised. The passive voice indicates that the action is being done to the subject (you), rather than by the subject.

Description:
περιτεμνησθε is a command to be circumcised. In the context of ancient Greek culture, circumcision was a common practice among Jewish and some non-Jewish groups. The command to be circumcised may have been given as part of a religious or cultural initiation ritual, or as a medical procedure. In modern times, the word may be used in a metaphorical sense to mean "to cut away" or "to remove something unwanted or unnecessary."
