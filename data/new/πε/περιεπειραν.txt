Word: περιεπειραν

Etymology: The word περιεπειραν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: περι (peri), which means "around" or "about," and επειραν (epeiran), which means "to try" or "to attempt." Therefore, the literal meaning of περιεπειραν is "to try around" or "to attempt around."

Grammar: περιεπειραν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb περιπειράομαι (peripeirao), which means "to try all around" or "to attempt on all sides." In this form, the verb indicates that the action was completed in the past by a group of people.

Description: περιεπειραν is a rare and complex word that is not commonly used in modern Greek. It appears only once in the New Testament (Acts 19:13) and is used to describe a group of Jewish exorcists who attempted to cast out evil spirits by invoking the name of Jesus. The word conveys the idea of a desperate and futile attempt to achieve something by trying all possible means.
