I'm sorry, but the word "περιπατηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "περιπάτηση" (peripatisi), which means "walk" or "stroll". 

Etymology: The word "περιπάτηση" comes from the verb "περιπατώ" (peripato), which means "to walk around". The prefix "περι-" (peri-) means "around" or "about", and the root "πατ-" (pat-) means "to walk". 

Grammar: "Περιπάτηση" is a feminine noun in the singular form. Its plural form is "περιπατήσεις" (peripatiseis). 

Description: "Περιπάτηση" refers to the act of walking or strolling, usually for leisure or exercise. It can also refer to a specific walk or stroll, such as a walk in the park or a stroll along the beach.
