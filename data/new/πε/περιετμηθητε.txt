Word: περιετμηθητε

Etymology: The word περιετμηθητε is derived from the Greek verb περιτέμνω (peritémno), which means "to circumcise." The prefix περι- (peri-) means "around" or "about," while the root word τέμνω (témno) means "to cut."

Grammar: περιετμηθητε is a second person plural passive imperative verb form in the aorist tense. It is formed by adding the prefix περι- to the verb ετμήθητε (etmíthite), which is the second person plural passive imperative form of the verb τέμνω (témno). The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: περιετμηθητε is a command to a group of people to be circumcised. In the context of ancient Greek culture, circumcision was a common practice among Jewish and some non-Jewish groups. The use of the passive voice in this verb form suggests that the act of circumcision is being done to the subject rather than by the subject.
