Word: περιτμηθηναι

Etymology: The word περιτμηθηναι comes from the Greek verb περιτέμνω (peritémno), which means "to circumcise". The word is formed by adding the reflexive suffix -θηναι (-thenai) to the verb stem.

Grammar: περιτμηθηναι is a passive aorist infinitive form of the verb περιτέμνω (peritémno). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: περιτμηθηναι means "to be circumcised" or "to have been circumcised". It is a verb form that describes the passive experience of undergoing circumcision, a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the foreskin of the penis. In ancient Greek culture, circumcision was a common practice among Jews and some other groups, and it was often seen as a sign of religious or cultural identity. Today, circumcision is still practiced in some cultures and religions, but it is also a subject of debate and controversy.
