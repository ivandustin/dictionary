Word: περιερχομενων

Etymology: 
The word περιερχομενων is a present participle form of the Greek verb περιέρχομαι (perierchomai), which is derived from the prefix περι- (peri-), meaning "around," and the verb ἔρχομαι (erchomai), meaning "to come." Therefore, περιερχομενων can be translated as "those who are coming around" or "those who are going around."

Grammar:
περιερχομενων is a present participle in the masculine, plural, genitive case. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the present stem of the verb. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and in this case, it is used to indicate that the participle is modifying a noun in the genitive case.

Description:
περιερχομενων is a word that describes a group of people who are moving around or circling something. It can be used in a literal sense, such as a group of people walking around a building, or in a figurative sense, such as a group of people discussing a topic from different angles. The word can also be used to describe a continuous action or state of being, as the present participle form suggests.
