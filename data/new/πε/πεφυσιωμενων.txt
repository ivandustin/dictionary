Word: πεφυσιωμενων

Etymology: The word πεφυσιωμενων is a Greek verb that comes from the root word φυσιόω (physiόō), which means "to inflate" or "to swell". The prefix πε- (pe-) indicates a completed action, so πεφυσιωμενων means "having been inflated" or "having been swollen".

Grammar: πεφυσιωμενων is a participle in the passive voice, which means it describes a state or condition of the subject rather than an action. It is in the masculine, plural, genitive case, which means it modifies a noun that is masculine, plural, and in the genitive case.

Description: πεφυσιωμενων can be translated as "of those who have been inflated" or "of those who have been swollen". It is often used in medical contexts to describe a condition of swelling or inflammation in the body. In ancient Greek literature, it can also be used metaphorically to describe a person or group that has become arrogant or prideful.
