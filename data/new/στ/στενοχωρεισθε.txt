Word: στενοχωρεισθε

Etymology:
The word στενοχωρεισθε comes from the Greek root words στενός (stenos) meaning "narrow" and χωρέω (choreo) meaning "to make room for". The suffix -εισθε (-eisthe) indicates that the word is in the present passive tense, meaning "you are being narrowed/made to feel cramped".

Grammar:
στενοχωρεισθε is a verb in the present passive tense, second person plural form. It is derived from the verb στενοχωρέω (stenochoreo), which means "to be in a narrow or confined space" or "to be distressed or anxious". The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action themselves.

The word is often used in a figurative sense, to describe a sense of being trapped or limited in some way.
