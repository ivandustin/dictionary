The word "στας" (stas) is a Greek verb in the present tense, second person singular form. It comes from the ancient Greek verb "ἵστημι" (histēmi), which means "to stand" or "to place". In modern Greek, "στας" is used to indicate that someone is standing or staying in a particular place. 

In terms of grammar, "στας" is a regular verb that follows the conjugation pattern of verbs ending in "-ω" in the present tense. It is also a transitive verb, meaning it requires a direct object to complete its meaning. 

Example: Στας εκεί! (Stas ekei!) - Stand there!
