The word "στεγην" (stegēn) is a Greek noun that means "roof" or "covering". It is derived from the verb "στέγω" (stegō), which means "to cover" or "to protect". In terms of grammar, "στεγην" is in the accusative case, which is used to indicate the direct object of a verb. 

In ancient Greek society, roofs were typically made of thatch or tiles and were an important part of a building's structure. The word "στεγην" can also be used metaphorically to refer to protection or shelter in a broader sense.
