Word: βεβαμμένον

Etymology:
The word βεβαμμένον is derived from the Greek verb βάπτω (báptō), which means "to dip" or "to immerse". The prefix βε- (be-) is a perfective prefix that indicates completion or finality. Therefore, βεβαμμένον can be translated as "dipped completely" or "fully immersed".

Grammar:
βεβαμμένον is a neuter singular participle in the perfect tense. The perfect tense in Greek indicates a completed action with ongoing results. The participle form indicates that the action of dipping or immersing has been completed, but the state of being fully immersed continues.

Description:
βεβαμμένον is an adjective that describes something that has been fully immersed or dipped. It can be used to describe an object that has been dipped in a liquid, such as a piece of cloth that has been dyed. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a person who is fully committed or dedicated to a particular cause or belief.
