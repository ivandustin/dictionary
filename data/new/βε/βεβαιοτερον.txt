Word: βεβαιοτερον

Etymology:
βεβαιοτερον is a comparative form of the Greek adjective βεβαῖος (bebaios), which means "firm, secure, certain". The word is derived from the verb βαίνω (baino), which means "to go, to walk". The prefix βε- (be-) is an intensifier, which gives the adjective a stronger meaning.
