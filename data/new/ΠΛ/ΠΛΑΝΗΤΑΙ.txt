Description: In Greek mythology and astronomy, "πλανηται" refers to the planets in our solar system. These celestial bodies are characterized by their ability to move across the night sky, unlike the fixed stars. The ancient Greeks identified five planets visible to the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. These planets were considered to be gods or divine beings in Greek mythology. Today, the term "πλανηται" is still used to describe the planets in scientific and astronomical contexts.
