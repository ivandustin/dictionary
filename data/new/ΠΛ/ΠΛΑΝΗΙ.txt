Etymology: The word "πλανητής" (planētēs) comes from the Greek word meaning "wanderer." In ancient times, the planets were observed to move across the night sky in a way that distinguished them from the fixed stars, hence the name.

Grammar: In Greek, "πλανητής" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It belongs to the second declension, and its genitive form is "πλανήτου" (planētou).

Description: "Πλανητής" is the Greek word for "planet." In astronomy, it refers to a celestial body that orbits around a star, is not a satellite of another planet, and is not a star itself. In our solar system, there are eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets vary in size, composition, and other characteristics. They are also visible to the naked eye and have been known since ancient times.
