Description: αξων is a term used in biology to refer to the long, slender projection of a nerve cell that conducts electrical impulses away from the cell body. The axon is covered by a myelin sheath, which helps to insulate and speed up the transmission of electrical signals. The length of an axon can vary greatly, from a few micrometers to over a meter in length. The axon is a crucial component of the nervous system, allowing for the transmission of information between neurons and ultimately enabling the brain to control the body's movements and functions.
