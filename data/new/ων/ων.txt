Word: ων

Etymology: ων is the genitive form of the Greek letter omega (Ω), which is the last letter of the Greek alphabet. The letter omega has been used in Greek language since ancient times and is believed to have originated from the Phoenician letter ʿayin.

Grammar: ων is a Greek noun ending that indicates the genitive case. In Greek grammar, the genitive case is used to show possession, origin, or relationship between two nouns. For example, in the phrase "το βιβλίο του μαθητή" (the book of the student), "του μαθητή" is in the genitive case and indicates that the book belongs to the student.

Description: ων is not a standalone word in Greek, but rather a noun ending that is added to the stem of a noun to indicate the genitive case. It is commonly used in Greek language and can be found in many words, such as "ανθρώπων" (of humans), "θεών" (of gods), and "γυναικών" (of women).
