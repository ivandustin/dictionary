Word: εισερχησθε

Etymology:
The word εισερχησθε is derived from the Greek verb εισέρχομαι (eiserchomai), which means "to enter" or "to go in". It is formed from the prefix εις (eis), meaning "into", and the verb ερχομαι (erchomai), meaning "to come".

Grammar:
εισερχησθε is a second person plural present middle/passive imperative verb in Greek. It is used to give a command or instruction to a group of people, telling them to enter or go in. The middle/passive voice indicates that the action is being done to or for the subject, rather than by the subject.

Description:
εισερχησθε is a verb that is often used in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the Gospels and the Book of Acts. It is used in a variety of contexts, such as when Jesus tells his disciples to enter a house (Mark 6:10), when the apostles enter the temple to preach (Acts 5:21), or when Paul tells the Corinthians to enter into a state of purity (2 Corinthians 6:17). The word conveys a sense of movement and action, and is often used in a literal sense to describe physical entry or movement into a space.
