Word: εισελθων

Etymology: εισελθων is a Greek word that comes from the combination of two words: εις (eis) meaning "into" and ελθων (elthon) meaning "coming". Therefore, εισελθων means "coming into" or "entering".

Grammar: εισελθων is the aorist participle of the Greek verb εισερχομαι (eiserchomai) which means "to enter". As a participle, it functions as an adjective and can be declined in different cases, genders, and numbers to agree with the noun it modifies.

Description: εισελθων is a word that describes an action of entering or coming into a place. It can be used in various contexts, such as in a narrative or a command. For example, in the New Testament, it is used to describe the action of Jesus entering the temple (Mark 11:11) or the disciples entering a house (Mark 14:13). In a command, it can be used to instruct someone to enter a place, such as "εισελθων εις το δωματιον" (enter into the room).
