Word: ειποντα

Etymology: ειποντα is the aorist participle of the Greek verb εἶπον (eipon), which means "I said" or "I spoke". The verb comes from the root word ειπ-, which means "to say" or "to speak".

Grammar: ειποντα is a masculine accusative singular form of the aorist participle. In Greek grammar, participles are verbal adjectives that can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. The aorist tense refers to a completed action in the past.

Description: ειποντα can be translated as "having said" or "having spoken". It is often used in Greek literature to introduce a direct quote or to describe an action that has already taken place. For example, in the sentence "ειποντα ταυτα, απηλθεν" (eiponta tauta, apelthen), which means "having said these things, he departed", ειποντα introduces the direct quote of what was said before the action of departing.
