Word: εικόνα

Etymology: The word εικόνα (eikona) comes from the ancient Greek word εἰκών (eikṓn), which means "image" or "likeness". It is derived from the verb εἴκω (eíkō), which means "to resemble" or "to be like".

Grammar: In Greek, εικόνα is a feminine noun. It is declined in the singular and plural, and can be used as the subject or object of a sentence. For example, "Η εικόνα είναι όμορφη" (I eikona einai omorfi) means "The image is beautiful".

Description: εικόνα refers to an image, picture, or representation of something. It can be a physical object, such as a painting or photograph, or a mental image in one's mind. In Greek Orthodox Christianity, εικόνα also refers to religious icons, which are considered to be windows into the spiritual world. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe a person or thing that is a perfect representation of something else.
