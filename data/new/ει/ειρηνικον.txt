Word: ειρηνικόν

Etymology:
The word ειρηνικόν (eirēnikón) is derived from the Greek word ειρήνη (eirḗnē), which means "peace". The suffix -ικόν (-ikón) is added to the end of the word to form an adjective, meaning "related to peace" or "peaceful".

Grammar:
ειρηνικόν is a neuter singular adjective in the nominative case. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if ειρηνικόν were to modify a feminine or masculine noun, it would change to ειρηνική or ειρηνικός, respectively.

Description:
ειρηνικόν is an adjective that describes something as peaceful or related to peace. It can be used to describe a person, place, or thing that is calm, tranquil, or non-violent. For example, one might use the word ειρηνικόν to describe a peaceful protest or a serene landscape.
