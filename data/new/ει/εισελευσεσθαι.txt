The word "εισελευσεσθαι" (eiseleusésthai) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, middle voice, infinitive mood. 

Etymology: The word is derived from the combination of the prefix "εις" (eis), meaning "into," and the verb "ελευσομαι" (eleusomai), meaning "to come." Therefore, "εισελευσεσθαι" means "to come into" or "to enter."

Grammar: As mentioned, "εισελευσεσθαι" is in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. The middle voice suggests that the subject is performing the action on themselves, rather than having it done to them by someone else. The infinitive mood indicates that the verb is being used as a noun, rather than as a specific action in a sentence.

Description: "Εισελευσεσθαι" is a versatile verb that can be used in a variety of contexts. It can refer to physically entering a place, such as a building or a city. It can also be used metaphorically to describe entering into a state of mind or a new phase of life. In the New Testament, it is often used to describe entering into the kingdom of God or into eternal life.
