Word: ειλατο

Etymology:
The word ειλατο (eilato) is a conjugated form of the Greek verb "αιρέω" (aireo), which means "to take, to lift, to choose". The verb is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁er- ("to move, to lift, to raise").

Grammar:
ειλατο (eilato) is the third person singular, aorist middle-passive indicative form of the verb "αιρέω" (aireo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description:
ειλατο (eilato) can be translated as "he/she/it took, lifted, chose (for himself/herself/itself)". The middle-passive voice suggests that the subject took the action for his/her/its own benefit or was affected by the action in some way. The aorist tense indicates that the action was completed in the past, without any indication of its duration.
