Word: εισελθητε

Etymology: 
The word εισελθητε comes from the Greek verb εισέρχομαι (eiserchomai), which means "to enter" or "to go in". It is formed by combining the prefix εις (eis), meaning "into", and the verb ερχομαι (erchomai), meaning "to come".

Grammar:
εισελθητε is the second person plural aorist subjunctive form of the verb εισέρχομαι (eiserchomai). In Greek, the subjunctive mood is used to express doubt, uncertainty, or a hypothetical situation. The aorist tense refers to a completed action in the past, and the second person plural indicates that the action is being performed by a group of people.

Description:
εισελθητε is a command or request for a group of people to enter or go into a place. It is often used in religious or ceremonial contexts, such as in the Bible when Jesus tells his disciples to "enter" the kingdom of heaven. The subjunctive mood adds a sense of uncertainty or doubt, suggesting that the action may or may not be carried out.
