The word "ειων" (pronounced "ee-on") is a Greek adjective that means "eternal" or "everlasting". 

Etymology: The word comes from the Greek root "αιων" (pronounced "eh-on"), which means "age" or "era". The prefix "ει-" (pronounced "ee-") is added to indicate the adjective form, meaning "pertaining to" or "characterized by".

Grammar: In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. "Ειων" is in the masculine singular nominative case, meaning it modifies a singular masculine noun in the subject position of a sentence.
