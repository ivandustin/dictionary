The word δοκων (dokōn) is a Greek noun that means "opinion" or "belief". It comes from the verb δοκεῖν (dokein), which means "to seem" or "to appear". In terms of grammar, δοκων is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. It can also be declined in other cases and numbers, such as δοκοντος (dokontos) in the genitive singular form. In ancient Greek philosophy, the concept of δόξα (doxa), which is related to δοκων, referred to the realm of appearances and opinions, as opposed to the realm of true knowledge and reality.
