Etymology: The word "δούλος" (doulos) comes from the ancient Greek word "δέω" (deo), which means "to bind" or "to tie up". This reflects the idea that a slave or servant is bound to their master or employer.

Grammar: "Δούλος" (doulos) is a masculine noun in Greek and is declined like other second declension nouns. Its plural form is "δοῦλοι" (douloi).

Description: In ancient Greece, slavery was a common practice and slaves were considered property rather than people. Slaves were often acquired through warfare or were born into slavery. They were expected to perform various tasks for their masters, such as manual labor, household chores, or even sexual services. Slavery was abolished in Greece in the 19th century.
