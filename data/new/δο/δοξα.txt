The word "δοξα" (doxa) is a Greek noun that means "glory" or "honor". It comes from the Greek verb "δοκεῖν" (dokein), which means "to seem" or "to appear". In ancient Greek philosophy, "doxa" was used to refer to opinions or beliefs that were not necessarily true or based on knowledge, but rather on appearances or perceptions. In grammar, "doxa" is a feminine noun of the first declension, and its genitive form is "δόξης" (doxēs).
