The word "δοθηναι" (dothēnai) is a Greek verb in the aorist passive infinitive form. It comes from the root verb "δίδωμι" (didōmi), which means "to give". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is receiving the action rather than performing it.

In English, "δοθηναι" can be translated as "to be given" or "having been given". It is often used in the context of receiving a gift or a reward. For example, "τῷ δοθῆναι τὸ βραβεῖον" (tō dothēnai to brabeion) means "to be given the prize".

In terms of grammar, "δοθηναι" is an infinitive, which means it functions as a verbal noun rather than a finite verb. It can be used as the subject or object of a sentence, or as the complement of certain verbs.

Overall, "δοθηναι" is a useful verb in Greek for expressing the idea of receiving something, and its aorist passive form gives it a specific sense of completion and passivity.
