The word δουλον (doulos) is a Greek noun that means "slave" or "servant". It comes from the Greek verb δουλευω (douleuo), which means "to serve" or "to be a slave". In terms of grammar, δουλον is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. It can also be declined in other cases, such as δουλου (genitive singular) or δουλοις (dative plural). In ancient Greek society, slavery was a common practice and slaves were considered property rather than individuals with rights. The word δουλον is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe believers who have willingly submitted themselves to serve God.
