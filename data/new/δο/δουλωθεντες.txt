Word: δουλωθεντες

Etymology:
The word δουλωθεντες is derived from the Greek verb δουλόω (douloo), which means "to enslave" or "to make someone a slave". The suffix -θεντες (-thentes) is a passive participle ending, indicating that the action of enslavement was done to the subject of the verb.

Grammar:
δουλωθεντες is a passive participle in the nominative plural form. In Greek, participles are verbal adjectives that can be used to modify nouns or act as standalone verbs. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the people being enslaved) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:

In ancient Greek society, slavery was a common practice, and many people were enslaved for various reasons, including debt, poverty, and being born into a slave family. The word δουλωθεντες carries connotations of powerlessness, oppression, and exploitation.
