Etymology:
The word δουλος (doulos) comes from the Greek root δεσ-, which means "to bind" or "to tie up." It originally referred to a slave or servant who was bound to their master or employer.

Grammar:
δουλος is a masculine noun in Greek. It is in the nominative case, which is the case used for the subject of a sentence. In the plural form, it becomes δουλοι (douloi).

Description:
δουλος is a term used in ancient Greek society to refer to a slave or servant who was owned by another person. Slavery was a common practice in ancient Greece, and slaves were considered property rather than people. They were often used for manual labor, such as farming or mining, and were not allowed to own property or have any legal rights. The term δουλος is still used in modern Greek to refer to a servant or employee, but it no longer carries the connotation of slavery.
