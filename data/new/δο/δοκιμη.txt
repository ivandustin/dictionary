The word δοκιμη (dokime) is a Greek noun that means "trial" or "test". It comes from the verb δοκιμάζω (dokimazo), which means "to test" or "to prove". In terms of grammar, δοκιμη is a feminine noun in the nominative singular form. It can also be declined in other cases and numbers, such as δοκιμής (dokimes) in the genitive singular form or δοκιμαί (dokimai) in the nominative plural form. In ancient Greek, δοκιμη was often used in legal contexts to refer to a trial or examination of evidence. In modern Greek, it is still used in this sense, as well as in the context of testing or evaluating something.
