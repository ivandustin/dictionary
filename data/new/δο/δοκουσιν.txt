The word δοκουσιν (dokousin) is a present active indicative form of the Greek verb δοκέω (dokéō), which means "to seem" or "to appear." It is derived from the noun δόκος (dókos), which means "opinion" or "belief." In grammar, δοκουσιν is the third person plural form, indicating that the subject of the sentence is a group of people or things who seem or appear to be doing something.
