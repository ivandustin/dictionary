The word δοκον (dokon) is a Greek noun that means "beam" or "plank". It is derived from the Greek verb δέχομαι (dechomai), which means "to receive" or "to accept". In grammar, δοκον is a masculine noun in the accusative case. It can be used in both singular and plural forms. In the New Testament, the word is often used metaphorically to refer to a person's faults or shortcomings, which can be compared to a beam in one's eye.
