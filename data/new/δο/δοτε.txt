The word "δοτε" is a verb in the Greek language, specifically in the imperative mood and second person plural form. It is derived from the root word "δίδωμι" (didomi), which means "to give". The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests, so "δοτε" translates to "give" or "grant" in English. In terms of grammar, it is a regular verb in the second person plural form, meaning it is conjugated the same way for all subjects in that form.
