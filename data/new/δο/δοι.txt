The word "δοι" (doi) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, which means it refers to a completed action in the past. It is the second person singular form of the verb "δίδωμι" (didomi), which means "to give". The etymology of "δίδωμι" is uncertain, but it is believed to be related to the Sanskrit word "dadati" and the Latin word "do". In Greek grammar, "δοι" is a subjunctive mood form, which is used to express a wish, a possibility, or a hypothetical situation.
