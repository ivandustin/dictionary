The word "δουλοι" (douloi) is a plural noun in Greek that means "slaves" or "servants". It comes from the Greek word "δουλος" (doulos), which means "slave" or "bondservant". In terms of grammar, "δουλοι" is a third declension noun in Greek, meaning that its endings change depending on its case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, etc.). 

In ancient Greek society, slavery was a common practice and slaves were considered property rather than people. They were often captured in war or born into slavery, and were forced to work for their owners without pay. Slaves could be used for a variety of tasks, such as farming, mining, or domestic work. 

Today, the word "δουλοι" is still used in modern Greek to refer to slaves or servants, but it can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is subservient or oppressed.
