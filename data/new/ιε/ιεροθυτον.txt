Description: ιεροθυτον was an important ritual in ancient Greek religion. It involved the sacrifice of an animal, usually a bull or a goat, to the gods. The animal was first led to the altar, where it was adorned with garlands and had its horns gilded. The priest then performed a series of rituals, including the sprinkling of water and the recitation of prayers, before finally slitting the animal's throat and offering it to the gods. The meat was then cooked and shared among the worshippers as part of a communal feast. The ιεροθυτον was seen as a way of appeasing the gods and ensuring their favor, as well as a way of strengthening the bonds of community among the worshippers.
