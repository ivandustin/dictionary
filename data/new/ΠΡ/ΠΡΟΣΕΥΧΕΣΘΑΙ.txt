Grammar: "Προσευχέσθαι" is a verb in the present middle/passive participle form of the Greek language. It is derived from the verb "προσεύχομαι" (proseúchomai), which means "to pray" or "to offer a prayer." The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the one praying and the one being prayed to.
