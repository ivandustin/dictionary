Etymology: The word "προσευχονται" (proseuchontai) comes from the Greek verb "προσεύχομαι" (proseuchomai), which means "to pray" or "to make a prayer." It is derived from the combination of the preposition "πρός" (pros), meaning "towards," and the verb "εὔχομαι" (euchomai), meaning "to pray" or "to wish."

Grammar: "Προσευχονται" is the third person plural form of the present tense of the verb "προσεύχομαι" (proseuchomai). In Greek, verbs change their endings to indicate the subject and tense. The "-ονται" ending indicates that the subject is third person plural (they) and the action is happening in the present.

Prayer is a form of communication with a higher power or a spiritual practice in which individuals express their thoughts, desires, or gratitude.
