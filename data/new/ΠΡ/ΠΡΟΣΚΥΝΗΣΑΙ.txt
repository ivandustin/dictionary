Etymology: The word "προσκύνησαι" comes from the Greek verb "προσκυνέω" (proskynéo), which means "to worship" or "to bow down before." It is derived from the combination of the preposition "πρός" (pros), meaning "towards," and the verb "κυνέω" (kynéo), meaning "to kiss." In ancient Greece, the act of worship often involved bowing down and kissing the ground or the feet of a deity or a respected person.

Grammar: "Προσκύνησαι" is the aorist imperative form of the verb "προσκυνέω" (proskynéo) in the second person singular. The aorist tense is used to express a completed action in the past, and the imperative mood is used to give a command or request. Therefore, "προσκύνησαι" translates to "worship!" or "bow down!"
