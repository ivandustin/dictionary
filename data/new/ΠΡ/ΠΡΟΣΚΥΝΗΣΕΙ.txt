Etymology: The word "προσκυνήσει" comes from the Greek verb "προσκυνώ" (proskynó), which means "to worship" or "to bow down before." It is derived from the combination of the preposition "πρός" (pros), meaning "towards," and the verb "κυνέω" (kynéo), meaning "to kiss" or "to adore."

Grammar: "Προσκυνήσει" is the third person singular future tense form of the verb "προσκυνώ" (proskynó). In Greek grammar, verbs are conjugated according to tense, person, and number. The future tense indicates an action that will happen in the future. The third person singular form refers to a single subject, and in this case, it means "he/she/it will worship" or "he/she/it will bow down before."
