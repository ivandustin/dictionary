Etymology: The word "προσηλυτών" (prosēlytōn) comes from the Greek verb "προσηλύτευσεν" (prosēlyteusen), which means "to convert" or "to join." It is derived from the preposition "πρός" (pros), meaning "towards," and the verb "ἡλύτευσεν" (ēlyteusen), meaning "to come" or "to go."

Grammar: "Προσηλυτών" is a noun in the genitive case, singular form. In Greek grammar, the genitive case is used to indicate possession, origin, or relationship. It is often translated as "of" or "belonging to" in English.

Description: "Προσηλυτών" refers to proselytes, individuals who have converted to a different religion or belief system. In the context of Greek history and culture, it specifically refers to Gentiles (non-Jews) who converted to Judaism. Proselytes were required to undergo a process of conversion, including circumcision for males, in order to fully integrate into the Jewish community. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to converts in other religious or ideological contexts.
