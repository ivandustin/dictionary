Sorry, I cannot define the word "καμηλου" as it is not a valid Greek word. It seems to be a misspelling of the Greek word "καμήλου" which means "of a camel" in English. 

Etymology: The word "καμήλου" comes from the Greek noun "κάμηλος" (kamēlos) which means "camel". 

Grammar: "Καμήλου" is the genitive singular form of the word "κάμηλος" (kamēlos) which is used to indicate possession or relationship to a noun in the sentence. 

Description: "Καμήλου" is a Greek word that is used to describe something that belongs to or is related to a camel. It can be used in various contexts such as in zoology, agriculture, or even in everyday language to describe objects or products that are made from camel's milk or hair.
