Word: κατεργαζεσθε

Etymology: κατεργαζεσθε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κατεργάζομαι (katergazomai), which means "to work out" or "to accomplish." It is derived from the prefix κατά (kata), which means "down" or "according to," and the verb ἐργάζομαι (ergazomai), which means "to work."

Grammar: κατεργαζεσθε is a second-person plural present middle/passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εσθε (-esthe) to the present stem κατεργαζ- (katergaz-). The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, or that the action is being done to or for the subject.

Description: κατεργαζεσθε is a command or an exhortation to a group of people to work out or accomplish something. The context in which it is used will determine the specific meaning of the verb. It could be used in a physical sense, such as "work out your muscles," or in a metaphorical sense, such as "work out your salvation." The middle/passive voice suggests that the action is being done for the benefit of the subject, rather than for someone else.
