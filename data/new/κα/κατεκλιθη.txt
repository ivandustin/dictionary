Word: κατεκλιθη

Etymology:
The word κατεκλιθη is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κλίνω (klinó), which means "to lean" or "to incline". The prefix κατά (katá) means "down" or "towards", so κατεκλιθη can be translated as "to be inclined downwards" or "to be laid down".

The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it could be translated as "it was inclined downwards" or "it was laid down".
