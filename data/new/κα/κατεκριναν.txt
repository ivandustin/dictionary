Word: κατεκρίναν (katekrinan)

Etymology: κατεκρίναν comes from the Greek verb κρίνω (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix κατα- (kata-) adds the meaning of "down" or "against", so κατεκρίναν means "they judged against" or "they condemned".

Grammar: κατεκρίναν is the third person plural, aorist active indicative form of the verb κρίνω. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice means that the subject (they) performed the action.

Description: κατεκρίναν is a word that describes a negative judgment or condemnation. It can be used in a legal context, such as a court case where someone is found guilty and condemned. It can also be used in a more general sense to describe a negative judgment or criticism of someone's actions or behavior.
