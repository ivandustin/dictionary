Word: καταλυων

Etymology: καταλυων is the present participle of the Greek verb καταλύω (katalyō), which means "to dissolve, to break up, to destroy, to overthrow". The word is derived from the prefix κατά (kata), meaning "down" or "against", and the verb λύω (lyō), meaning "to loosen, to untie, to release".

Grammar: καταλυων is a masculine singular present participle in the nominative case. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -ων (-ōn) to the stem of the verb. They function as adjectives and describe an ongoing action or state. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence.

For example, it could describe a person who is tearing down a building, or a political movement that is working to overthrow a government.
