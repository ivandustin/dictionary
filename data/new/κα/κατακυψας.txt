Etymology:
The word κατακυψας (katakypsas) is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: κατά (kata) meaning "down" or "towards" and κύπτω (kypto) meaning "to bend" or "to stoop". Therefore, κατακυψας can be translated as "to bend down towards" or "to stoop down".

Grammar:
κατακυψας is a second-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. It is derived from the verb κύπτω (kypto) and has the prefix κατά (kata) added to it. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.
