Word: καταλεγεσθω

Etymology:
The word καταλεγεσθω comes from the Greek verb καταλέγω (katalego), which means "to enroll" or "to register". It is derived from the prefix κατά (kata), meaning "down" or "according to", and the verb λέγω (lego), meaning "to say" or "to speak".

Grammar:
καταλεγεσθω is a passive imperative verb in the third person singular form. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action. The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests. In this case, the verb is in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past.

Description:
καταλεγεσθω is a command to be enrolled or registered. It is often used in a religious context, such as in the New Testament of the Bible, where it is used to urge believers to be enrolled in the book of life. The word can also be used more generally to refer to any kind of enrollment or registration, such as in a school or organization.
