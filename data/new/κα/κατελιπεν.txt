Word: κατελιπεν

Etymology: κατελιπεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word λείπω (leipo), which means "to leave" or "to abandon". The prefix κατα (kata) adds the meaning of "completely" or "thoroughly", so κατελιπεν means "to completely leave" or "to abandon completely".

Grammar: κατελιπεν is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb καταλείπω (kataleipo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.
