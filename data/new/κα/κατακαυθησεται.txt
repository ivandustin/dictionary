Word: κατακαυθησεται

Etymology: κατα- (kata-, prefix meaning "down" or "against") + καυθήσεται (kauthēsetai, future passive indicative of καίω, kaio, meaning "to burn"). Therefore, κατακαυθησεται means "it will be burned down" or "it will be consumed by fire".

Grammar: κατακαυθησεται is a third-person singular future passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the future tense marker -σ- to the stem καυθη-, which is derived from the verb καίω (kaio, "to burn"). The prefix κατα- (kata-, "down" or "against") indicates that the action of burning will be directed towards the subject of the sentence.

Description: κατακαυθησεται is a Greek verb that describes the action of something being burned down or consumed by fire.
