Word: κατεπαυσεν

Etymology: κατεπαυσεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word παύω (pauo), which means "to stop" or "to cease." The prefix κατα- (kata-) adds the meaning of "down" or "completely," so κατεπαυσεν can be translated as "completely stopped" or "ceased."

Grammar: κατεπαυσεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb καταπαύω (katapauo), which means "to cause to cease" or "to put an end to." In this form, it refers to a single action that was completed in the past.

Description: κατεπαυσεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Mark 4:39, where it describes Jesus calming a storm on the Sea of Galilee. The phrase is often translated as "He rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!'" The use of κατεπαυσεν emphasizes the sudden and complete cessation of the storm, highlighting Jesus' power and authority.
