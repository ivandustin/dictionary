Word: κατηγαγον

Etymology:
The word κατηγαγον is a Greek verb that comes from the root words κατά (kata) meaning "down" or "against" and ἄγω (agō) meaning "to lead" or "to bring". The prefix κατά (kata) gives the verb a sense of motion downwards or against something.

Grammar:
κατηγαγον is the aorist tense of the Greek verb καταγαγώ (katagagō), which means "to lead down" or "to bring down". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past.

Description:
κατηγαγον is used in the New Testament of the Bible in Luke 19:35, where it describes the disciples bringing a colt to Jesus for him to ride into Jerusalem. The verb emphasizes the action of bringing the colt down from a higher place to a lower place, which in this case was from the Mount of Olives down into the city of Jerusalem. The word can also be used more generally to describe bringing something or someone down from a higher place to a lower place.
