Word: κατακρισιν

Etymology: κατακρισιν is a Greek word that comes from the verb κατακρίνω (katakrinō), which means "to condemn" or "to judge against". The suffix -σιν (-sin) is a nominalizing suffix that turns the verb into a noun, so κατακρισιν means "condemnation" or "judgment against".

Grammar: κατακρισιν is a feminine noun in the nominative case. In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their gender, number, and case. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence or the predicate nominative, which renames the subject. κατακρισιν can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive (κατακρίσεως) or the accusative (κατακρίσιν).

Description: κατακρισιν refers to the act of condemning or judging against someone or something. It can be used in a legal context, such as a court judgment, or in a moral or ethical context, such as a condemnation of someone's behavior. The word carries a negative connotation and implies disapproval or censure.
