Word: κατηχηθησαν

Etymology: The word κατηχηθησαν comes from the Greek verb κατηχέω (katecheo), which means "to instruct" or "to teach." The verb is derived from the prefix κατά (kata), which means "down" or "according to," and the verb ἠχέω (echeo), which means "to sound" or "to echo."

Grammar: κατηχηθησαν is a passive verb in the aorist tense, third person plural form. The aorist tense in Greek is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an unspecified group of people) received the action of the verb rather than performing it themselves.

Description: κατηχηθησαν can be translated as "they were instructed" or "they were taught." The word implies that a group of people received some kind of formal instruction or education. The context in which the word appears would determine the specific nature of the instruction or teaching.
