Word: κατεποθήσαν (katepothēsan)

Etymology: κατεποθήσαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πίνω (pinō), which means "to drink." The prefix κατα- (kata-) means "down" or "completely," so κατεποθήσαν means "to drink down completely" or "to swallow."

Description: κατεποθήσαν is a strong verb that is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the act of the soldiers who crucified Jesus Christ dividing his garments among themselves. The verse in which it appears is John 19:23-24: "When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another, 'Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.' This was to fulfill the scripture, 'They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.' So the soldiers did these things."
