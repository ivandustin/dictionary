Word: κατακειμένου

Etymology: κατα- (kata-, prefix meaning "down") + κεῖμαι (keimai, "to lie down"). The word κατακειμένου is the genitive form of the present participle κατακείμενος (katakeimenos), which means "lying down" or "reclining".

Grammar: κατακειμένου is a masculine singular genitive form of the present participle κατακείμενος. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the stem of the verb. The present participle can function as an adjective, describing a noun or pronoun, or as a verb, indicating ongoing action.

Description: κατακειμένου can be translated as "of the one who is lying down" or "of the one who is reclining". It is often used in Greek literature to describe the posture of someone at a meal or banquet, as it was customary for Greeks to recline on couches while eating. The word can also be used more generally to describe someone who is resting or lying down.
