Word: καθαρίσας

Etymology:
The word καθαρίσας comes from the Greek verb καθαρίζω (katharízo), which means "to purify" or "to cleanse". It is derived from the adjective καθαρός (katharós), which means "clean" or "pure".

Grammar:
καθαρίσας is the aorist active participle of the verb καθαρίζω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the participle form indicates that the verb is being used as an adjective.

Description:
καθαρίσας can be translated as "having purified" or "having cleansed". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the actions of Jesus or God in purifying or cleansing people from sin. For example, in 1 John 1:7, it says "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin." The use of καθαρίσας emphasizes the completeness and finality of the purification or cleansing that has taken place.
