Word: καινοτερον

Etymology: καινοτερον is a Greek word that comes from the root word καινός (kainos), meaning "new" or "fresh". The suffix -τερον (-teron) is a comparative suffix, meaning "more" or "greater". Therefore, καινοτερον can be translated as "newer" or "more new".

Grammar: καινοτερον is a neuter singular adjective in the nominative case. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, if καινοτερον were to modify a feminine noun, it would become καινοτερη (kainoteri) in the nominative singular.

Description: καινοτερον is used to describe something that is newer or more recent than something else. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as describing a new product, a new idea, or a new development. It is a common word in modern Greek and is often used in everyday conversation.
