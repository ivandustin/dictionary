Word: κατειργασθαι

Etymology:
The word κατειργασθαι is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix κατα- (meaning "down" or "against") and the verb εργαζομαι (meaning "to work" or "to do"). Therefore, κατειργασθαι means "to work down" or "to work against".

Grammar:
κατειργασθαι is a verb in the aorist tense, passive voice, and infinitive mood. In Greek, the aorist tense refers to a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. The infinitive mood is used to express the idea of an action without specifying who is performing it.

Description:
κατειργασθαι can be translated as "to be brought to nothing" or "to be made ineffective". It is often used in a negative sense, indicating that something has been destroyed or rendered useless. In the New Testament, it is used to describe the nullification of the law by faith in Christ (Romans 3:31) and the destruction of the works of the devil by the Son of God (1 John 3:8).
