Word: κατηγορεισθαι

Etymology:
The word κατηγορεισθαι comes from the Greek verb κατηγορέω (katēgoreō), which means "to accuse" or "to charge". The word is derived from the prefix κατά (kata), which means "down" or "against", and the verb ἀγορεύω (agoreuō), which means "to speak in public".

Grammar:
κατηγορεισθαι is a passive verb in the present tense, third person singular form. It is formed by adding the suffix -σθαι (-sthai) to the stem κατηγορει- (katēgorei-). The verb is in the middle voice, which indicates that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action.
