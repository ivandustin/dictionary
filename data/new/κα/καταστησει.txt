Word: καταστησει

Etymology: κατα- (kata-, prefix meaning "down" or "against") + στησει (stēsei, future tense of the verb στήνω, meaning "to set up" or "to establish"). Therefore, καταστησει means "to establish down" or "to set up against".

Grammar: καταστησει is a third-person singular future active indicative form of the Greek verb καταστήνω (katastēnō), which means "to establish", "to set up", or "to appoint". It is formed by adding the future tense suffix -σει (-sei) to the stem καταστην- (katastēn-).

It can be used in various contexts, such as establishing a new law, setting up a business, or appointing someone to a position of authority. The word implies a sense of stability and permanence, as opposed to something that is temporary or fleeting.
