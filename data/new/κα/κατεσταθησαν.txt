Word: κατεσταθησαν

Etymology: κατεσταθησαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word σταθμός (stathmos), meaning "station" or "post." The prefix κατα- (kata-) means "down" or "under," so κατεσταθησαν can be translated as "they were stationed down" or "they were placed under."

Grammar: κατεσταθησαν is the third person plural aorist passive indicative form of the verb καθίστημι (kathistemi), which means "to place," "to establish," or "to appoint." The aorist tense indicates that the action was completed in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject (in this case, "they") received the action of the verb.

Description: κατεσταθησαν can be translated as "they were stationed," "they were placed," or "they were established." The context in which the word is used will determine the exact meaning. For example, in the New Testament, κατεσταθησαν is used to describe the appointment of elders in the church (Titus 1:5). In other contexts, it could refer to the placement of soldiers or the establishment of a new government.
