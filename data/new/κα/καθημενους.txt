Word: καθημενους

Etymology:
The word καθημενους is derived from the Greek verb καθίζω (kathizó), which means "to sit down" or "to seat". The word is formed from the prefix κατά (kata), which means "down", and the verb ίζω (izó), which means "to sit".

Grammar:
καθημενους is the accusative plural form of the Greek adjective καθημενος (kathimenos), which means "sitting" or "seated". The adjective is declined according to the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. In this case, it modifies a masculine plural noun in the accusative case.

Description:
καθημενους is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe a group of people who are sitting down. It appears in several passages, including Mark 2:4, where it describes the crowd gathered around Jesus, and Acts 13:14, where it describes the congregation in the synagogue at Pisidian Antioch. The word conveys a sense of stillness and quietness, as opposed to standing or moving around.
