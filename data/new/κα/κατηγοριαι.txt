Word: κατηγορίαι

Etymology: The word κατηγορίαι (katēgoriai) comes from the Greek root words κατά (kata) meaning "down" or "against" and ἀγορά (agora) meaning "assembly" or "marketplace". Together, κατηγορίαι means "accusations" or "charges" in Greek.

Grammar: κατηγορίαι is a plural noun in Greek, meaning it refers to multiple accusations or charges. It is declined in the first declension, with the nominative singular form being κατηγορία (katēgoria).

Description: κατηγορίαι is a term used in legal contexts to refer to formal accusations or charges brought against someone in a court of law. It can also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of accusation or charge made against someone. In modern Greek, the term κατηγορία (katēgoria) is still used in legal contexts, but it can also be used more generally to mean "category" or "classification".
