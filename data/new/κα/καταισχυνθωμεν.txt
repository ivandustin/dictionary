Etymology:
The word καταισχυνθωμεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word αἰσχύνομαι (aischynomai), which means "to feel shame or disgrace." The prefix κατα- (kata-) adds the meaning of "down" or "against," so καταισχυνθωμεν can be translated as "we are being shamed" or "we are being disgraced."
