Word: καταποντισθηι

Etymology: The word καταποντισθηι is a Greek verb in the passive voice, which means "to be sunk" or "to be drowned". It is derived from the combination of two Greek words: κατά (kata), which means "down" or "against", and ποντίζω (pontizo), which means "to sink" or "to drown".

Grammar: καταποντισθηι is a third-person singular passive aorist form of the verb καταποντίζω (katapontizo). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: καταποντισθηι is a word that describes the state of being sunk or drowned. It can be used to describe a ship that has sunk to the bottom of the sea, or a person who has drowned in water. The word has a sense of finality and permanence, as the subject of the verb cannot be brought back to life or restored to its former state.
