Word: καθαρας

Etymology:
The word καθαρας (katharas) is derived from the Greek word καθαρός (katharos), which means "clean" or "pure". It is believed to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European root *kathar-, which means "pure" or "clear".

Grammar:
καθαρας is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. It is also an adjective that can be used to describe a masculine noun. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if καθαρας is used to describe a feminine or neuter noun, it would change to καθαρή or καθαρό, respectively.
