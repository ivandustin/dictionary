I'm sorry, but the word "καταργησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It may be a misspelling of the word "κατάργηση" (katarghi̱si̱), which means "abolition" or "cancellation". 

Etymology: The word "κατάργηση" comes from the verb "καταργώ" (katargó), which means "to abolish" or "to cancel". The prefix "κατά" (katá) means "down" or "against", and the root "έργο" (érgo) means "work" or "action".

Grammar: "Κατάργηση" is a feminine noun in the singular form. Its plural form is "καταργήσεις" (katarghi̱seis).

Description: "Κατάργηση" refers to the act of abolishing or cancelling something, such as a law, a policy, or a system. It can also refer to the state of being abolished or cancelled. The word is commonly used in legal and political contexts.
