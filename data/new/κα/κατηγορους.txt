Word: κατηγόρους

Etymology:
The word κατηγόρους comes from the Greek word κατήγορος (katēgoros), which is derived from the verb κατηγορέω (katēgoreō), meaning "to accuse". The word is composed of two parts: κατά (kata), which means "against" or "down", and ἀγορεύω (agoreuō), which means "to speak in public". Therefore, κατήγορος originally meant "one who speaks against someone in public".

Grammar:
κατηγόρους is the plural form of κατήγορος, which is a masculine noun in the second declension. In Greek, nouns are declined according to their gender, number, and case. The second declension is characterized by the ending -ος in the nominative singular and -ου in the genitive singular. The plural form of the second declension ends in -οι in the nominative and -ων in the genitive.

Description:
κατηγόρους refers to "accusers" or "prosecutors" in Greek. In ancient Athens, the role of the κατήγορος was to bring charges against someone in a public trial. The κατήγορος had to present evidence and arguments to prove the guilt of the accused. The word is still used in modern Greek to refer to someone who accuses or denounces another person.
