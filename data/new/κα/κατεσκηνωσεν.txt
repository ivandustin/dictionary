Word: κατεσκηνωσεν

Etymology:
The word κατεσκηνωσεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word σκηνή (skēnē), which means "tent" or "dwelling." The prefix κατα- (kata-) means "down" or "according to," so κατεσκηνωσεν can be translated as "he pitched his tent" or "he dwelt according to."

Grammar:
κατεσκηνωσεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice means that the subject (he) performed the action. The indicative mood indicates a statement of fact.

Description:
κατεσκηνωσεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible in John 1:14, which reads: "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth." In this context, κατεσκηνωσεν is translated as "dwelt among us." The word conveys the idea of God coming down to live among humanity in the person of Jesus Christ.
