The word "καλεσητε" is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the Greek verb "καλέσετε" (kalesete), which is the second person plural form of the imperative mood of the verb "καλώ" (kalo), meaning "to call" or "to invite". 

Etymology: The verb "καλώ" comes from the ancient Greek word "καλέω" (kaleo), which has Indo-European roots and is related to the English word "call".

Grammar: "Καλέσετε" is a regular verb in the second conjugation in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix "-ετε" to the stem "καλέσ-". 

Description: "Καλέσετε" is used to give a command or instruction to a group of people to call or invite someone. For example, "Καλέσετε τον Γιάννη να έρθει στο πάρτι" (Kalesete ton Gianni na erthei sto parti) means "Call/Invite Giannis to come to the party".
