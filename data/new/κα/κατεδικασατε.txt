Word: κατεδικασατε

Etymology: The word κατεδικασατε comes from the Greek verb καταδικάζω (katadikazo), which means "to condemn" or "to sentence". It is formed by combining the prefix κατά (kata), which means "down" or "against", and the verb δικάζω (dikazo), which means "to judge" or "to try".

Grammar: κατεδικασατε is the second person plural, aorist tense, active voice form of the verb καταδικάζω. This means that it is used to address a group of people and refers to a completed action in the past. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description: κατεδικασατε means "you condemned" or "you sentenced" in English. It is often used in legal contexts to refer to a judgment or verdict that has been reached in a court of law. The word can also be used more broadly to refer to any situation in which someone is found guilty or held responsible for something.
