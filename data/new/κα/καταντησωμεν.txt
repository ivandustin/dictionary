Grammar: καταντησωμεν is a first-person plural aorist subjunctive active verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -σωμεν (-somen) to the stem καταντη-. The aorist tense indicates a past action that is completed, while the subjunctive mood expresses a possibility or a hypothetical situation.

Description: καταντησωμεν is a rare verb in Greek and is only found in the New Testament in the Bible. It is used in the book of Hebrews 4:11, where it is translated as "let us labour" or "let us strive".
