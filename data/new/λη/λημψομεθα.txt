Word: λημψομεθα

Etymology: λημψομεθα is a Greek verb that comes from the root word λαμβάνω (lambanō), which means "to take" or "to receive". The prefix λημψ- (lēmps-) adds the meaning of "to take hold of" or "to seize".

Grammar: λημψομεθα is a first-person plural middle voice verb in the aorist tense. In Greek, the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. The aorist tense refers to a completed action in the past.

Description: λημψομεθα means "we took hold of" or "we seized" in English. It implies a deliberate and forceful action, as opposed to a passive or accidental one. The middle voice also suggests that the subject was directly involved in the action and may have benefited from it.
