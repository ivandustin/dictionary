Description:
The word λυκος is often used in Greek mythology and literature to refer to wolves, which were considered to be powerful and dangerous animals.

In modern Greek, the word λυκος is still used to refer to wolves, but it can also be used metaphorically to describe a person who is aggressive or predatory.
