The word "λυθηι" (lythēi) is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the Greek verb "λυθεί" (lytheí), which is the third person singular form of the aorist passive tense of the verb "λύω" (lyō), meaning "to loosen" or "to untie". 

Etymology: The verb "λύω" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *leu- meaning "to loosen, divide, cut apart". 

Grammar: "λυθεί" is a passive verb form, indicating that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon rather than performing the action. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past. 

Description: "λυθεί" can be translated as "he/she/it was loosened" or "he/she/it was untied". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the healing of physical ailments, such as when Jesus "loosed" a woman from her infirmity in Luke 13:12.
