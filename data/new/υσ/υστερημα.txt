Word: υστερημα

Etymology: The word υστερημα comes from the Greek word υστερέω (hystereó), which means "to be late" or "to lag behind." The suffix -μα (-ma) is added to the verb stem to form a noun, indicating the result or product of the action.

Grammar: υστερημα is a neuter noun in Greek, and its plural form is υστερηματα (hysteremata). It is often used in the accusative case, as in "το υστερημα της εξέτασης" (to hysterema tis exetasis), which means "the result of the exam."

Description: υστερημα refers to the result or outcome of an action that has been delayed or postponed. It can also refer to a deficiency or lack of something that should have been done or provided earlier. In modern Greek, it is often used in legal or administrative contexts to refer to a penalty or fine imposed for a late payment or failure to comply with a deadline.
