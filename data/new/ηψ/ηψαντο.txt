Word: ηψαντο

Etymology: ηψαντο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb "άπτω" (apto), which means "to touch" or "to grasp". The verb is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁ep-, meaning "to take hold of".

Grammar: ηψαντο is the third person plural, aorist middle-passive indicative form of the verb "άπτω" (apto). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: ηψαντο can be translated as "they touched" or "they grasped" in English. The form indicates that the action was performed by a group of people in the past, and that they were both the doers and the receivers of the action.
