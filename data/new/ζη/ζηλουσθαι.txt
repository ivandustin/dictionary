Word: ζηλουσθαι

Etymology:
The word ζηλουσθαι (zēlousthai) is derived from the Greek root word ζῆλος (zēlos), which means "zeal" or "ardor". The suffix -ουσθαι (-ousthai) is a reflexive ending, indicating that the action is being done to oneself. Therefore, ζηλουσθαι (zēlousthai) means "to be zealous for oneself" or "to be jealous".

Grammar:
ζηλουσθαι (zēlousthai) is a verb in the present tense, middle voice, and infinitive mood. In Greek, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, ζηλουσθαι (zēlousthai) can be translated as "to be zealous for oneself" or "to be jealous".

Description:
ζηλουσθαι (zēlousthai) is a complex word that can have both positive and negative connotations. On the one hand, it can refer to a healthy sense of competition or ambition, where one is striving to improve oneself and achieve success. On the other hand, it can also refer to a negative emotion of envy or jealousy, where one is resentful of others' success and desires to have what they have. In either case, the word emphasizes the idea of being passionate and fervent in one's pursuits.
