ζησασα (zēsasa) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, feminine gender, and singular number. It is the aorist participle of the verb ζάω (zao), which means "to live" or "to be alive". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the participle form indicates that the action was performed by a female subject. Therefore, ζησασα can be translated as "having lived" or "having been alive" in English.
