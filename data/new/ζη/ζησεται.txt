ζησεται (zēsetai) is a Greek verb in the future tense, third person singular form. It comes from the root verb ζάω (záō), which means "to live". The suffix -σεται (-setai) is added to the root verb to indicate the future tense and the third person singular subject. 

Therefore, ζησεται means "he/she/it will live" in English.
