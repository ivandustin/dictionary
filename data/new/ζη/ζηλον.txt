The word ζηλον (zēlon) is a Greek noun that means "zeal" or "envy". It is derived from the Greek verb ζηλόω (zēloō), which means "to be jealous" or "to be zealous". In ancient Greek literature, ζηλον was often used to describe a strong passion or fervor for something, whether it be a person, an idea, or a cause. However, in later Greek, the word took on a more negative connotation and came to mean envy or jealousy. In terms of grammar, ζηλον is a neuter noun in the singular form.
