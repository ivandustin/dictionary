Description: ισραηλείτης is a term used to refer to a member of the ancient Israelite people, who were the descendants of the biblical patriarch Jacob (also known as Israel). The Israelites are known for their monotheistic religion, which is based on the worship of Yahweh (also known as Jehovah), and for their history of being enslaved in Egypt and later being led out of slavery by Moses. The Israelites eventually settled in the land of Canaan (modern-day Israel and Palestine), where they established the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Today, the term ισραηλείτης is still used to refer to Jewish people, who are considered to be the descendants of the ancient Israelites.
