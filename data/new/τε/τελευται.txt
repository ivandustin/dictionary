I'm sorry, but the word "τελευται" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "τελευταίοι" which means "last" or "final". 

Etymology: The word "τελευταίοι" comes from the Greek root "τέλος" meaning "end" or "goal".

Grammar: "τελευταίοι" is the plural form of the adjective "τελευταίος" and agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies.

Description: "τελευταίοι" is used to describe the final or last item in a series or sequence. It can also be used to describe the ultimate or ultimate outcome of a situation.
