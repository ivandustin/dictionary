The word τετράρχου (tet-rar-khou) is a Greek noun that means "tetrarch" or "ruler of a quarter". It is derived from the Greek words τέσσερα (téssera), meaning "four", and ἄρχων (árkhōn), meaning "ruler" or "leader". In ancient times, a tetrarch was a governor or ruler of a quarter or province, especially in the Roman Empire. The term was also used in the New Testament to refer to Herod Antipas, who was the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea during the time of Jesus. In modern usage, the term tetrarch is sometimes used to refer to a ruler or leader of a small territory or region.
