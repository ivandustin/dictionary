τελωνης (telōnēs) is a Greek noun that refers to a tax collector or customs officer. The word is derived from the combination of two words: τελος (telos), meaning "tax" or "duty," and ὠνέομαι (ōneomai), meaning "to buy" or "to purchase." In ancient Greece, telōnēs were responsible for collecting taxes on goods that were imported or exported through ports and borders. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe the profession of Matthew, one of Jesus' disciples, who was a tax collector before he became a follower of Jesus. In terms of grammar, τελωνης is a masculine noun in the nominative case.
