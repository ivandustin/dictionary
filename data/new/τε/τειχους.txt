τεῖχος (teichos) is a Greek word that means "wall" or "fortification". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *dheigh-, which means "to mold, form, or shape". In Greek grammar, τεῖχος is a neuter noun of the second declension, and its nominative singular form is τεῖχος. 

In ancient Greece, τεῖχος was an important part of the defense system of cities and fortresses. Walls were built around cities to protect them from enemy attacks, and they were often fortified with towers, gates, and other defensive structures. The construction of walls was a major engineering feat, and the quality of the walls was often a reflection of the wealth and power of the city.

In literature, τεῖχος is often used metaphorically to represent a barrier or obstacle that must be overcome. For example, in Homer's Odyssey, the hero Odysseus must overcome the walls of the city of Troy in order to win the Trojan War. The word τεῖχος is also used in the New Testament to describe the walls of the heavenly city in the book of Revelation.
