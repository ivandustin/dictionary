τεφρωσας (tephrōsas) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, second person singular form. It comes from the root word τέφρα (téphra), which means "ashes" or "dust". The verb τεφρώνω (tephrṓnō) means "to cover with ashes" or "to sprinkle with dust". 

In the aorist tense, τεφρωσας indicates a completed action in the past. Therefore, τεφρωσας means "you covered with ashes" or "you sprinkled with dust" in English. 

Example: Τεφρωσας το κεφάλι σου με τη σκόνη. (Tephrōsas to kefáli sou me ti skóni.) - You covered your head with dust.
