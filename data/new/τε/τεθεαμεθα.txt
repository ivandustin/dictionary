Word: τεθεαμεθα

Etymology: τεθεαμεθα is a Greek verb that comes from the root word θεάομαι (theaomai), which means "to see, to behold." The prefix τε- (te-) adds emphasis to the verb, giving it the meaning of "having seen" or "having beheld."

Grammar: τεθεαμεθα is a first-person plural perfect middle/passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The perfect tense indicates that the action of seeing or beholding has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: τεθεαμεθα can be translated as "we have seen" or "we have beheld." It is often used in a religious or spiritual context to describe a divine vision or revelation. In the New Testament, it is used to describe the disciples' experience of seeing the transfiguration of Jesus (Matthew 17:9) and the risen Christ (Luke 24:34).
