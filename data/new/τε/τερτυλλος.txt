τερτυλλος (tertullos) is a Greek word of uncertain etymology. It is believed to be a loanword from a non-Greek language, possibly Phrygian or Lydian. 

In terms of grammar, τερτυλλος is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. 

As for its description, there is not much information available about the meaning or usage of τερτυλλος in ancient Greek literature. Some scholars have suggested that it may have been a type of musical instrument or a type of dance. However, this is purely speculative and there is no concrete evidence to support these theories.
