τεκνια (teknia) is a Greek word that means "children" or "offspring". It is the plural form of τεκνον (teknon), which means "child". The word is derived from the Greek verb τικτω (tikto), which means "to give birth". In terms of grammar, τεκνια is a neuter noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive τεκνων (teknon) or the accusative τεκνα (tekna). In ancient Greek literature, the word is often used to refer to the children of gods or heroes.
