τεῖχος (teichos) is a Greek word that means "wall" or "fortification". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *dheigh-, which means "to mold, form, or shape". In Greek mythology, the walls of Troy were famously built by the god Apollo and his son, the mortal king Laomedon. 

In terms of grammar, τεῖχος is a neuter noun in the singular form. Its nominative and accusative forms are identical, and its genitive and dative forms are also identical. 

In description, τεῖχος can refer to any type of wall or fortification, whether it is made of stone, brick, or other materials. It can also be used metaphorically to describe a barrier or obstacle that separates people or things.
