τελωναί (telōnaí) is a Greek word that refers to tax collectors or customs officials. The word comes from the combination of two words: τέλος (télos), meaning "tax" or "duty," and ὠνέομαι (ōnéomai), meaning "to buy" or "to purchase." In ancient Greece, the τελωναί were responsible for collecting taxes on goods that were imported or exported. In the New Testament, the τελωναί are often portrayed as corrupt and despised by the Jewish people. The word is plural, and the singular form is τελώνης (telṓnēs). In terms of grammar, τελωναί is a third-declension feminine noun in Greek.
