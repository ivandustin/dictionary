τεθραμμένος (tethrammenos) is a Greek adjective that means "nurtured" or "brought up". It is derived from the verb τρέφω (trefo), which means "to nourish" or "to bring up". The prefix τε- (te-) indicates completion or perfect tense, so τεθραμμένος implies that the person or thing has been fully raised or nurtured. 

In terms of grammar, τεθραμμένος is a masculine singular adjective in the nominative case. It can be declined to match the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. For example, τεθραμμένη (tethrammeni) is the feminine singular form, and τεθραμμένα (tethrammena) is the neuter plural form.

Overall, τεθραμμένος is a descriptive term that emphasizes the idea of being well-nurtured or well-raised. It can be used to describe a person who has had a good upbringing, or a plant or animal that has been well-cared for.
