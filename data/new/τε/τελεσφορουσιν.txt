τελεσφορουσιν (telesphorousin) is a Greek verb in the present active indicative form, third person plural. 

Etymology: The word is derived from the combination of two Greek words, τέλος (telos) meaning "end" or "goal" and φέρω (phero) meaning "to carry" or "to bring". Therefore, τελεσφορουσιν can be translated as "they carry to the end" or "they bring to completion".

Grammar: τελεσφορουσιν is a present tense verb, indicating that the action is happening currently. It is in the active voice, meaning that the subject is performing the action. The third person plural form indicates that the subject is a group of people or things.

Description: The word τελεσφορουσιν is not commonly used in modern Greek language. It is mostly found in ancient Greek texts, particularly in philosophical and religious contexts. The word conveys the idea of bringing something to completion or achieving a goal.
