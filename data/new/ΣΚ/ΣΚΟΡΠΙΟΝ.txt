Etymology: The word "σκορπιόν" (skorpion) comes from the Greek word "σκορπίζω" (skorpízo), which means "to scatter" or "to disperse." This is likely due to the scorpion's ability to scatter its venomous tail.

Grammar: In Greek, "σκορπιόν" is a masculine noun of the second declension. It belongs to the nominative case, and its genitive form is "σκορπίου" (skorpiou).

Description: A scorpion is an arachnid characterized by its eight legs, two pincers, and a long, curved tail ending with a venomous stinger. They are found in various habitats worldwide, including deserts, forests, and grasslands. Scorpions are nocturnal creatures and feed on insects, spiders, and other small animals. They use their venomous stinger to immobilize or kill their prey. While most scorpion species are not dangerous to humans, some can deliver venomous stings that may cause pain, swelling, and other symptoms.
