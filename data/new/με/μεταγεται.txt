Word: μεταγεται

Etymology:
The word μεταγεται is derived from the Greek verb μεταγίγνομαι (metagígnomai), which means "to change, to transfer, to move from one place to another." The prefix μετα- (meta-) means "beyond, after, or with," while the root word γίγνομαι (gígnomai) means "to become, to be born, or to happen."

Grammar:
μεταγεται is a third-person singular present indicative form of the verb μεταγίγνομαι (metagígnomai). It is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action. The verb is conjugated in the present tense, indicating that the action is happening now.

Description:
μεταγεται can be translated to English as "is transferred" or "is moved." It is often used in a figurative sense to describe a change or transfer of something intangible, such as power, authority, or responsibility. The word can also be used in a literal sense to describe the physical movement of an object from one place to another.
