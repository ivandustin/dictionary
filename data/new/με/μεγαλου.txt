Sorry, I cannot define the word "μεγαλου" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the Greek word "μεγάλου" which means "of the big" or "of the great" in English. 

Etymology: μεγάλου comes from the Greek word "μέγας" (megas) which means "big" or "great".

Grammar: μεγάλου is the genitive form of the adjective μεγάλος (megalos) which means "big" or "great". It is used to indicate possession or relationship.

Description: μεγάλου is a Greek word that is commonly used in everyday language to describe something that is large or impressive. It can be used to describe physical objects, such as buildings or mountains, or abstract concepts, such as ideas or accomplishments.
