Etymology:
The word μεγαλωσυνης (megalousynēs) is derived from the Greek words μεγάλος (megálos) meaning "great" or "large" and σύνηθες (sýnēthes) meaning "habitual" or "customary". The suffix -νης (-nēs) is added to form a noun, indicating the quality or state of being great or large in a habitual or customary way.

μεγαλωσυνης is a feminine noun in the genitive case. In Greek, nouns have different forms depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and is often translated in English as "of" or "'s". For example, "the wisdom of the ages" would be translated as "η σοφία των αιώνων" (i sophía ton aióno̱n) in Greek.
