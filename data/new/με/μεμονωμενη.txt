Word: μεμονωμένη

Etymology:
The word μεμονωμένη comes from the Greek verb μονώνω (monono), which means "to isolate" or "to separate". The prefix με- (me-) indicates that the action is done to oneself, so μεμονωμένη means "isolated" or "separated" in a reflexive sense.

Grammar:
μεμονωμένη is the feminine singular form of the past participle of the verb μονώνω. It agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies. For example, μεμονωμένη πόλη (isolated city) is feminine singular, while μεμονωμένο χωριό (isolated village) is neuter singular.

It can refer to physical isolation, such as an isolated island or a remote village, or to social isolation, such as a person who is cut off from society.
