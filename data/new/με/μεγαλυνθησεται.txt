Word: μεγαλυνθησεται

Etymology: The word μεγαλυνθησεται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word μεγαλύνω (megalyno), which means "to magnify" or "to enlarge". The suffix -θησεται (-thesetai) is a future passive indicative ending, which means that the verb is in the future tense and passive voice.

Grammar: μεγαλυνθησεται is a third-person singular future passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the future tense ending -θησεται to the stem μεγαλυν-, which means "to magnify". The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: μεγαλυνθησεται can be translated to English as "it will be magnified" or "it will be enlarged". The verb is often used in a figurative sense, to describe something that will be made greater or more important. In the New Testament of the Bible, the word is used in several passages to describe the exaltation of God or the glorification of Jesus Christ.
