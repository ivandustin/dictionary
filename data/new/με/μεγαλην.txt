The word μεγαλην (megalen) is a feminine singular form of the Greek adjective μεγάλος (megalos), which means "great" or "large". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *meg- which also gave rise to the English words "mega" and "magnify". In Greek grammar, μεγαλην is in the accusative case, which is used to indicate the direct object of a verb.
