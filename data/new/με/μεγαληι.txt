Sorry, I cannot define the word "μεγαληι" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the Greek word "μεγάλη" which means "big" or "great". 

Etymology: The word "μεγάλη" comes from the ancient Greek word "μέγας" (megas) which means "great" or "large".

Grammar: "μεγάλη" is a feminine singular form of the adjective "μεγάλος" (megalos) which means "big" or "great". It is used to describe feminine singular nouns.

Description: "μεγάλη" is a common Greek word used to describe the size or importance of something. It can be used to describe physical objects, abstract concepts, or people. For example, "μεγάλη πόλη" (megalē póli) means "big city" and "μεγάλη αξία" (megalē axía) means "great value".
