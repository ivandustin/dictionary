μετωπού (metopou) is a Greek noun that refers to the forehead or the front part of the head. 

Etymology: The word μετωπού comes from the combination of two Greek words: μέτωπον (metōpon) meaning "forehead" and the genitive case of the word οὖς (ous) meaning "ear".

Grammar: μετωπού is a singular noun in the genitive case. In Greek, the genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship between two nouns.

Description: The forehead is the part of the face above the eyebrows and below the hairline. It is an important part of the human body as it protects the brain and is also used for nonverbal communication, such as raising the eyebrows to express surprise or confusion. In ancient Greek culture, the forehead was considered an important feature of beauty and was often depicted in art.
