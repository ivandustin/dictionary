I'm sorry, but the word "μετανοησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "μετάνοια" (metanoia), which means "repentance" or "change of mind". 

Etymology: The word "μετάνοια" comes from the Greek words "μετά" (meta), meaning "after" or "beyond", and "νοῦς" (nous), meaning "mind". Therefore, "μετάνοια" literally means "beyond the mind" or "change of mind".

Grammar: "μετάνοια" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "μετανοίες" (metanoies).

Description: In Greek culture, "μετάνοια" is a concept that refers to the act of repentance and the change of one's behavior or way of thinking. It is often associated with religious or spiritual practices, but it can also be used in a secular context to describe a change of heart or a shift in perspective.
