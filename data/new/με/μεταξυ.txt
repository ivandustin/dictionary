μεταξυ (metaxy) is a Greek preposition that means "between" or "among". It is derived from the combination of the prefix "meta-" meaning "beyond" or "between" and the noun "axis" meaning "axle" or "pivot". In grammar, μεταξυ is used to indicate the relationship between two or more things that are in a middle position or in a state of being in between. It can also be used to express a sense of reciprocity or mutual action between two or more parties.
