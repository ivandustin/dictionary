Grammar: "μεγαλώνω" is a verb in the present tense, active voice, and indicative mood.

Description: "μεγαλώνω" is used to describe the action of something or someone growing or becoming larger in size or quantity. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the development or improvement of something or someone.
