Word: μετεσχεν

Etymology: μετεσχεν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix μετά (meta), which means "after" or "beyond," and the verb ἔσχεν (eschen), which means "to have" or "to hold." Therefore, μετεσχεν can be translated as "to have after" or "to participate in."

Grammar: μετεσχεν is the aorist tense of the verb μετέχω (metecho), which means "to share" or "to participate." In the aorist tense, the action is viewed as a single event that occurred in the past. 

Description: μετεσχεν is a verb that expresses the idea of participating in something after it has already happened. It can be used in various contexts, such as in sports, politics, or social events. For example, if someone missed a party but later found out about it, they could say "μετέσχον του πάρτι" (meteshon tou parti), which means "I participated in the party after it happened."
