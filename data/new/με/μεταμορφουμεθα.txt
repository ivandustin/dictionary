Word: μεταμορφουμεθα

Etymology:
μεταμορφουμεθα is a Greek word that comes from the combination of two words: μετά (meta) meaning "change" and μορφή (morphē) meaning "form". The word is derived from the verb μεταμορφόω (metamorphoō) which means "to transform" or "to change shape".

Grammar:
μεταμορφουμεθα is a first-person plural present passive indicative form of the verb μεταμορφόω (metamorphoō). It is used to indicate that the subject (we) are being transformed or changed. The word is in the present tense, indicating that the transformation is ongoing, and in the passive voice, indicating that the subject is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:

The word is often used in a spiritual or philosophical context to describe a process of personal growth or enlightenment. In Christian theology, the word is used to describe the transformation of Jesus Christ on the Mount of Transfiguration.
