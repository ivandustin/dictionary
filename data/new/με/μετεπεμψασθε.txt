Word: μετεπεμψασθε

Etymology: μετεπεμψασθε is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix μετά (meta), which means "after" or "beyond," and the verb ἐπιστρέφω (epistrepho), which means "to turn back" or "to return." Therefore, μετεπεμψασθε can be translated as "you returned" or "you sent back."

Grammar: μετεπεμψασθε is the second person plural aorist middle voice form of the verb μεταπέμπω (metapempo), which means "to send back" or "to return." In this form, the subject is "you" (second person plural), the action is completed in the past (aorist tense), and the verb is reflexive (middle voice), indicating that the subject is both the agent and the recipient of the action.

Description: μετεπεμψασθε is a verb that describes the act of sending something or someone back to its original location or sender. It can also refer to the act of returning to a previous location or state. In ancient Greek literature, this verb is often used in the context of military campaigns, where soldiers are sent back to their homeland or to their commanders for various reasons.
