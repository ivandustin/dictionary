Word: μεμιανται

Etymology: The word μεμιανται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word μιαίνω (miaino), which means "to defile" or "to pollute". The prefix με- (me-) adds the meaning of "inwardly" or "completely", so μεμιανται (memiantai) means "they are completely defiled" or "they are utterly polluted".

Grammar: μεμιανται is a third-person plural present indicative passive verb in Greek. It is conjugated from the verb μιαίνω (miaino), which is a first-conjugation verb. The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: μεμιανται is a strong word that conveys a sense of complete and utter defilement or pollution. It is often used in a moral or spiritual sense, to describe a state of corruption or impurity. In the New Testament, it is used to describe the defilement of the human heart and soul by sin.
