Word: μεθυσκεσθαι

Etymology:
The word μεθυσκεσθαι comes from the Greek root word μέθυσος (methysos), which means "drunkenness" or "intoxication". The suffix -κεσθαι (-kesethai) is a reflexive suffix that indicates the action is being done to oneself. Therefore, μεθυσκεσθαι means "to become intoxicated" or "to get drunk".

Grammar:
μεθυσκεσθαι is a verb in the present middle/passive participle form. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, and mood. The present tense indicates that the action is happening now, while the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, μεθυσκεσθαι can be translated as "I am getting drunk" or "I am becoming intoxicated".
