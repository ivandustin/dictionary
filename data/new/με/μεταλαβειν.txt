Etymology:
μεταλαβειν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: μετά (meta), which means "after" or "beyond," and λαβεῖν (labein), which means "to take" or "to seize." Therefore, μεταλαβειν means "to take hold of something after it has passed by" or "to grasp something that is beyond reach."

Grammar:
μεταλαβειν is an infinitive verb in the Greek language. It belongs to the aorist tense, which indicates a past action that is completed. The verb is formed by adding the prefix μετά (meta) to the verb λαβεῖν (labein), which means "to take" or "to seize."
