Word: μεταβεβηκαμεν

Etymology: The word μεταβεβηκαμεν is a conjugated form of the Greek verb μεταβαίνω (metabaino), which means "to pass over" or "to cross over". The verb is composed of two parts: μετά (meta), which means "after" or "beyond", and βαίνω (baino), which means "to go" or "to walk".

Grammar: μεταβεβηκαμεν is the first person plural, aorist active indicative form of the verb μεταβαίνω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (we) performed the action.

Description: μεταβεβηκαμεν can be translated as "we crossed over" or "we passed over". The word implies that the subject (we) moved from one place to another, possibly crossing a boundary or obstacle. The aorist tense suggests that the action was completed in the past, without any ongoing effects. The word can be used in a literal sense, such as crossing a river or a mountain range, or in a figurative sense, such as overcoming a challenge or obstacle.
