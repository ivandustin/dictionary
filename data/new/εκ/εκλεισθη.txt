Word: εκλεισθη

Etymology:
The word εκλεισθη is derived from the Greek verb κλείω (kleiō), which means "to close" or "to shut". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out" or "away", so εκλεισθη can be translated as "was closed" or "was shut out".

Grammar:
εκλεισθη is a third person singular passive aorist indicative form of the verb κλείω (kleiō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, εκλεισθη) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
εκλεισθη can be translated as "was closed" or "was shut out". It describes a past event in which something (or someone) was closed or shut out. The context in which the word is used will determine the specific meaning and implications of the action.
