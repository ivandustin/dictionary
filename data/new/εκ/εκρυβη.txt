Word: εκρυβη

Etymology: The word εκρυβη comes from the Greek verb κρύπτω (kryptō), which means "to hide" or "to conceal". The prefix εκ- (ek-) means "out of" or "from", so εκρυβη can be translated as "was hidden" or "was concealed".

Grammar: εκρυβη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb κρύπτω (kryptō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (in this case, εκρυβη) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: εκρυβη is a Greek verb that means "was hidden" or "was concealed". It is often used in the context of secrets or things that are kept hidden from others. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe things that are not immediately apparent or visible.
