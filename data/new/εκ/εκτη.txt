The word "εκτη" (ektē) is a Greek adjective that means "sixth" in English. 

Etymology: The word comes from the Greek prefix "εκ-" (ek-) meaning "out of" or "from" and the cardinal number "τέσσερα" (téssera) meaning "four". The prefix "εκ-" is added to the ordinal number "πέμπτος" (pémptos) meaning "fifth" to form the adjective "εκτός" (ektós) meaning "outside" or "except". The adjective "εκτός" is then modified to "εκτη" (ektē) to indicate the ordinal number "sixth".

Grammar: The word "εκτη" is a feminine singular form of the adjective. It agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies.

Description: The word "εκτη" is used to indicate the position of something in a series or sequence, specifically as the sixth item. For example, "Η εκτη μέρα της εβδομάδας" (I ekti méra tis evdomádas) means "The sixth day of the week".
