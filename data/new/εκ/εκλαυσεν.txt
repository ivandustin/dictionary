Word: εκλαυσεν

Etymology:
The word εκλαυσεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κλαίω (klaió), which means "to weep" or "to cry." The prefix εκ (ek) means "out" or "away," so εκλαυσεν can be translated as "he/she/it wept out" or "he/she/it cried away."

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.
