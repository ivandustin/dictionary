Word: εκλεισθησαν

Etymology: The word εκλεισθησαν is derived from the Greek verb κλείω (kleiō), which means "to close" or "to shut". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out" or "away", so εκλεισθησαν can be translated as "they were closed off" or "they were shut away".

Grammar: εκλεισθησαν is a third-person plural passive aorist indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "they") received the action of the verb rather than performing it themselves.

Description: εκλεισθησαν is a word that describes a state of being closed off or shut away. It can be used to describe physical objects that have been closed or sealed, as well as metaphorical situations where people or ideas are isolated or cut off from others. The word has a sense of finality or permanence, suggesting that once something has been closed off, it cannot be easily reopened or accessed again.
