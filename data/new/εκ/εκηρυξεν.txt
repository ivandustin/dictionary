Word: εκηρυξεν

Etymology: 
The word εκηρυξεν (ekēryxen) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κηρύσσω (kēryssō), which means "to proclaim" or "to announce". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκηρυξεν can be translated as "he proclaimed" or "he announced".

Grammar:
εκηρυξεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb κηρύσσω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates that the action is a statement of fact. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description:
εκηρυξεν is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (4:17).
