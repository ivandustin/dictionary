Word: εκινηθη

Etymology: The word εκινηθη comes from the Greek verb κινέω (kinéo), which means "to move" or "to stir". The prefix εκ- (ek-) in this word means "out" or "away", so εκινηθη can be translated as "was moved away" or "was stirred up".

Grammar: εκινηθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb κινέω (kinéo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, εκινηθη) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: εκινηθη can be translated as "was moved away" or "was stirred up". It describes a past action that involved the subject being moved or stirred by an external force. The context in which the word is used will determine the exact meaning and implications of the action.
