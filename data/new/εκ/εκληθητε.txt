Word: εκληθητε

Etymology: The word εκληθητε is derived from the Greek verb καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call" or "to summon". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκληθητε can be translated as "you were called out of" or "you were summoned from".

Grammar: εκληθητε is the second person plural aorist passive indicative form of the verb καλέω (kaleo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. Therefore, εκληθητε can be translated as "you all were called" or "you all were summoned".

Description: εκληθητε is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (22:14) and the First Epistle of Peter (2:9). In both instances, it is used to describe a group of people who have been called or summoned for a specific purpose. In Matthew, it is used in the parable of the wedding banquet, where the king sends out his servants to invite guests to his son's wedding feast. In Peter, it is used to describe the Christian believers, who are called out of darkness into God's marvelous light.
