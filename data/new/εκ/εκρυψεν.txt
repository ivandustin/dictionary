Word: εκρυψεν

Etymology: εκρυψεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρύπτω (kryptó), which means "to hide" or "to conceal". The prefix ε- (e-) in this case means "out" or "away", so εκρυψεν can be translated as "he/she/it hid away".

Grammar: εκρυψεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb κρύπτω (kryptó). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, rather than a continuous or ongoing action. The indicative mood indicates that the action is a statement of fact. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.
