Word: εκριζωθησεται

Etymology: 
The word εκριζωθησεται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρίζω (krizo), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out" or "away from", and the suffix θησεται (thesetai) is a third person singular future passive indicative form of the verb τίθημι (tithemi), which means "to place" or "to set". Therefore, the word εκριζωθησεται can be translated as "to be uprooted" or "to be removed from its place".

Grammar:
εκριζωθησεται is a third person singular future passive indicative form of the verb εκριζωνω (ekrizono), which means "to uproot" or "to remove from its place". The verb is in the future tense, indicating that the action of uprooting or removing will happen at some point in the future. The verb is also in the passive voice, indicating that the subject of the sentence (which is not specified in this form) will be acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:
εκριζωθησεται is a strong and powerful word that conveys the idea of something being forcefully uprooted or removed from its place. It can be used in a literal sense, such as when referring to a tree being uprooted from the ground, or in a figurative sense, such as when referring to a person or group being removed from power or influence. The word carries a sense of finality and permanence, suggesting that once something is uprooted, it cannot be easily put back in its place.
