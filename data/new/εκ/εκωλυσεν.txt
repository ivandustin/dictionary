Word: εκωλυσεν

Etymology:
The word εκωλυσεν (ekolysen) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κωλύω (koluo), which means "to hinder" or "to prevent." The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from," so εκωλυσεν can be translated as "he prevented" or "he hindered."

Grammar:
εκωλυσεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "he") performed the action. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description:
εκωλυσεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Acts 16:6-7, where it is translated as "forbidden" or "prevented." In this passage, the Holy Spirit prevents Paul and his companions from preaching in Asia and Bithynia, leading them to instead travel to Macedonia. The word conveys a sense of hindrance or obstruction, suggesting that the Holy Spirit had a specific plan for Paul and his companions that did not include preaching in those regions at that time.
