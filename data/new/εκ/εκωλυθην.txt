Word: εκωλυθην

Etymology:
The word εκωλυθην is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κωλύω (kōlýō), which means "to hinder" or "to prevent." The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from," so εκωλυθην can be translated as "I was prevented" or "I was hindered."

Grammar:
εκωλυθην is a first-person singular passive aorist indicative form of the verb κωλύω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject (in this case, "I") is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description:
εκωλυθην can be translated as "I was prevented" or "I was hindered." It implies that something or someone stopped the speaker from doing something they intended to do. The context of the sentence would determine what exactly the speaker was prevented from doing.
