The word "εκκλησία" (ekklesia) is a Greek term that has been used for centuries to refer to a gathering or assembly of people. It is derived from the words "ek" (out of) and "kaleo" (to call), which together mean "called out ones." In ancient Greece, the term was used to refer to the assembly of citizens who would gather to make decisions about the affairs of the city-state.

In the New Testament, the word "εκκλησία" is used to refer to the community of believers in Jesus Christ. It is often translated as "church" in English, but the original Greek term carries a deeper meaning than just a physical building or institution. It refers to the people who have been called out of the world to follow Christ and live in community with one another.

In terms of grammar, "εκκλησία" is a feminine noun in Greek. It is declined like other first-declension nouns, with the nominative singular form being "εκκλησία" and the genitive singular form being "εκκλησίας."

Overall, "εκκλησία" is a rich and complex term that carries both historical and theological significance. It speaks to the idea of community, gathering, and being called out of the world to live in a new way.
