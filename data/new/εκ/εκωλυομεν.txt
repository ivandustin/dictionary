Word: εκωλυομεν

Etymology:
The word εκωλυομεν (ekolymen) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κωλύω (koluo), which means "to hinder" or "to prevent." The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from," so εκωλυομεν can be translated as "we are being hindered" or "we are being prevented."

Grammar:
εκωλυομεν is a first-person plural present passive indicative verb in Greek. This means that it is used to describe an action that is happening to us (passive voice) in the present tense (present tense) and that we are the ones performing the action (first-person plural).

Description:
The word εκωλυομεν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in 1 Thessalonians 2:18, where the apostle Paul writes, "Therefore we wanted to come to you—even I, Paul, time and again—but Satan hindered us." In this context, εκωλυομεν is used to describe how Paul and his companions were prevented from visiting the Thessalonians by Satan. The word can also be used more generally to describe any situation where someone or something is hindering or preventing progress or movement.
