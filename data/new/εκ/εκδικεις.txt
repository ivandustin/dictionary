The word "εκδικεις" (ekdikeis) is a Greek verb that means "to avenge" or "to take revenge". 

Etymology: The word comes from the Greek root "δίκη" (dike), which means "justice" or "judgment", and the prefix "εκ-" (ek-), which means "out of" or "from". Therefore, "εκδικεις" literally means "to bring justice out of" or "to take justice from".

Grammar: "εκδικεις" is a second-person singular present active indicative verb in Greek. It can also be conjugated in other tenses and moods, such as the aorist tense ("εξεδίκησας", exedikisas) or the imperative mood ("εκδίκησε", ekdikise).

Description: The word "εκδικεις" is often used in the context of seeking revenge or retribution for a perceived wrongdoing or injustice. It can also be used in a more general sense to mean "to punish" or "to make someone pay for their actions". However, it is important to note that seeking revenge is generally not considered a positive or productive behavior, and there are often more constructive ways to address conflicts or grievances.
