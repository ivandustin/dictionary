Word: εκδιηγουμενοι

Etymology:
The word εκδιηγουμενοι (ekdiegoménoi) is a Greek verb in the present participle form, which comes from the root word διηγέομαι (diēgéomai), meaning "to narrate" or "to tell a story". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκδιηγουμενοι can be translated as "those who are narrating" or "those who are telling a story".

Grammar:
εκδιηγουμενοι is a present participle in the masculine plural form, which means it describes a group of people who are currently narrating or telling a story. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντας (-ontas) to the stem of the verb. The stem of διηγέομαι is διηγε-, so the present participle form is διηγούμενος (diēgoúmenos). The prefix εκ (ek) is added to the beginning of the present participle form to indicate that the action is taking place outside of the speaker or writer.
