Word: εκαθαρισθη

Etymology: The word εκαθαρισθη comes from the Greek verb καθαρίζω (katharízo), which means "to purify" or "to cleanse". The prefix εκα- (eka-) is a form of the prefix εκ- (ek-), which means "out of" or "from". Therefore, εκαθαρισθη can be translated as "was purified" or "was cleansed".

Grammar: εκαθαρισθη is a past tense verb in the passive voice. It is the third person singular form of the verb καθαρίζω in the aorist tense. The aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (which is not explicitly stated in this case) received the action of the verb.

Description: εκαθαρισθη is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John (11:55; 13:10; 15:3). In these passages, it is used to describe the act of purifying or cleansing oneself or others, both physically and spiritually. The word carries a sense of being made clean or pure, free from impurities or sin. In Christian theology, the concept of purification or cleansing is often associated with the forgiveness of sins and the attainment of salvation.
