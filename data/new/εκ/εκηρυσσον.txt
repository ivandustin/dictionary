Word: εκηρυσσον

Etymology: The word εκηρυσσον comes from the Greek verb κηρυσσω (kēryssō), which means "to proclaim" or "to announce". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκηρυσσον can be translated as "proclaimed from" or "announced out of".

Grammar: εκηρυσσον is the second person singular, aorist tense, active voice form of the verb κηρυσσω. It is used in the imperative mood, which is a command or request form. So, εκηρυσσον can be translated as "you proclaimed" or "you announced".

Description: εκηρυσσον is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (4:17). It is part of the message that Jesus Christ proclaimed when he began his public ministry: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." The word emphasizes the urgency and importance of the message, as it is a command to take action and turn away from sin.
