The word "εκαθεζομην" (ekathezomen) is a Greek verb in the present tense, middle voice, and indicative mood. It is derived from the root word "καθέζομαι" (kathézomai), which means "to sit down". The prefix "εκ" (ek) in this word means "out of" or "from".

In terms of grammar, the middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, "εκαθεζομην" can be translated as "I am sitting down for myself" or "I am sitting down on my own".

The word can be used to describe someone who is sitting down in a relaxed or comfortable position, or someone who is taking a break from standing or walking. It can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who is taking a break from a task or activity.

Example sentence: Κάθε μεσημέρι εκαθεζόμουν στο πάρκο για να ξεκουραστώ. (Kathe mesimeri ekahezomoun sto parko gia na xekourasto) - "Every afternoon, I would sit down in the park to rest."
