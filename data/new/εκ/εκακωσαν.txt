Word: εκακωσαν

Grammar: εκακωσαν is a third-person plural aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "they") performed the action. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.
