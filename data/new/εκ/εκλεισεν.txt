Word: εκλεισεν

Etymology: 
The word εκλεισεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κλείω (kleiō), which means "to close" or "to shut". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out" or "away", so εκλεισεν can be translated as "he/she/it closed out" or "he/she/it shut away".

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The indicative mood indicates that the action is a statement of fact. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.
