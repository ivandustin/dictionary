The word "εκτισται" (ektistai) is a Greek verb in the third person singular form of the aorist tense. It comes from the root word "κτίζω" (ktizo), which means "to create" or "to build". The prefix "εκ" (ek) means "out of" or "from", so "εκτισται" can be translated as "was created" or "was built".

In terms of grammar, "εκτισται" is a regular verb in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. It is also in the passive voice, indicating that the subject of the sentence (which is not specified in this case) is the recipient of the action rather than the doer.

Overall, "εκτισται" is a word that describes the act of creation or building in the past, and is commonly used in religious or philosophical contexts to refer to the creation of the world or the universe.
