Word: εκηρυχθη

Etymology:
The word εκηρυχθη (ekērychthē) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κηρύσσω (kēryssō), which means "to proclaim" or "to announce." The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from," so εκηρυχθη can be translated as "was proclaimed" or "was announced."

Grammar:
εκηρυχθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it could be translated as "it was proclaimed" or "he/she/it was announced."

Description:
εκηρυχθη is a word that describes a past event in which something was proclaimed or announced. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine what was proclaimed or announced. However, the word itself suggests that the announcement was made publicly and with some degree of authority or importance.
