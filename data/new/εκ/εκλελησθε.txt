Word: εκλελησθε

Etymology:
The word εκλελησθε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word λαμβάνω (lambanō), which means "to take" or "to receive." The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from," and the suffix θε (the) is a second-person plural ending, indicating that the verb is directed at a group of people. Therefore, εκλελησθε can be translated as "you have taken out" or "you have received from."

Grammar:
εκλελησθε is a second-person plural perfect passive indicative verb in Greek. The perfect tense indicates that the action was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "you") is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
εκλελησθε is a relatively rare word in Greek, occurring only once in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 4:8). In this context, the apostle Paul is rebuking the Corinthians for their pride and arrogance, saying that they have already received everything they need and are acting as if they are already kings. The word εκλελησθε emphasizes the idea that the Corinthians have already received everything they need, and therefore have no reason to boast or act superior to others.
