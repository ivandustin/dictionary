The word "εκδωσεται" is a verb in the Greek language. Its etymology can be traced back to the root word "δίδωμι" (didomi), which means "to give". The prefix "εκ" (ek) in this word means "out" or "away", so "εκδωσεται" can be translated as "to give out" or "to distribute".

In terms of grammar, "εκδωσεται" is a third-person singular present passive indicative verb. This means that it is currently happening (present tense), the subject is not doing the action themselves (passive voice), and the subject is a single entity (third-person singular).

In terms of description, "εκδωσεται" can be used in various contexts to describe the act of distributing or giving out something. It can refer to the distribution of information, goods, or services. For example, "Το βιβλίο εκδίδεται σε πολλές γλώσσες" (To vivlio ekdídetai se pollés glósses) means "The book is published in many languages".
