Word: εκριθη

Etymology: The word εκριθη comes from the Greek verb κρίνω (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκριθη can be translated as "was judged" or "was decided".

Grammar: εκριθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb κρίνω (krino). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description: εκριθη can be translated as "was judged" or "was decided". It is often used in legal or judicial contexts to describe a verdict or decision that has been reached. For example, in the New Testament, the word is used to describe the judgment of Jesus by Pontius Pilate: "Then Pilate said to him, 'So you are a king?' Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world—to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.' Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?' After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, 'I find no guilt in him'" (John 18:37-38, ESV).
