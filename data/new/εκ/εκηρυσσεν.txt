Word: εκηρυσσεν

Etymology:
The word εκηρυσσεν comes from the Greek verb κηρύσσω (kerusso), which means "to proclaim" or "to announce". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκηρυσσεν can be translated as "he proclaimed" or "he announced".

Grammar:
εκηρυσσεν is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb κηρύσσω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject (he) is performing the action of proclaiming or announcing.

Description:
εκηρυσσεν is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Mark (1:14-15). The passage reads: "Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.'" Here, εκηρυσσεν is used to describe Jesus' proclamation of the gospel message. The word emphasizes the active and public nature of Jesus' announcement, as he traveled throughout Galilee preaching the good news of God's kingdom.
