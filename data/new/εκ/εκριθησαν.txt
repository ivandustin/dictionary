Word: εκριθησαν

Etymology: 
The word εκριθησαν is a conjugated form of the Greek verb κρίνω (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The verb κρίνω comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *krei-, which means "to separate" or "to distinguish". 

Grammar: 
εκριθησαν is the third person plural, aorist passive indicative form of the verb κρίνω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (in this case, an implied "they") received the action of the verb rather than performing it themselves. 

Description: 
The word εκριθησαν can be translated to English as "they were judged" or "they were decided". The context in which the word is used would determine the exact meaning.
