Word: εκραξεν

Etymology: εκραξεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κράζω (krázo), which means "to shout" or "to cry out". The prefix εκ- (ek-) means "out" or "from", so εκραξεν can be translated as "he/she/it cried out" or "he/she/it shouted".

Grammar: εκραξεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb κράζω (krázo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement or asking a question, rather than expressing a wish or a command. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.

Description: εκραξεν is a verb that describes a sudden, loud, and possibly emotional outburst of sound. It can be used to describe someone shouting in anger, fear, excitement, or surprise. The verb is often used in the context of storytelling or narration, to describe a character's actions or reactions. For example, "Ο βασιλιάς εκραξεν από την έκπληξη" (O vasilías ekraksen apó tin ékplixi) means "The king cried out in surprise".
