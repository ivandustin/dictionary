Word: εκλυθωσιν

Etymology: The word εκλυθωσιν comes from the Greek verb κλύω (klýo), which means "to wash away" or "to rinse". The prefix εκ- (ek-) means "out" or "away", so εκλυθωσιν can be translated as "they are washed away" or "they are rinsed out".

Grammar: εκλυθωσιν is a third-person plural present passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. It is in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action themselves.
