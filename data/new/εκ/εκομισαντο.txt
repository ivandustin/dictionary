Word: εκομισαντο

Etymology:
The word εκομισαντο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κομίζω (komizo), which means "to bring" or "to carry". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates that the action is in the past tense, and the suffix -αντο (-anto) indicates that the action was performed by a group of people.

Grammar:
εκομισαντο is a third-person plural past tense verb in the Greek language. It is in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past. The verb is also in the passive voice, which means that the subject of the sentence (the people who carried or brought something) received the action rather than performing it themselves.

Description:
εκομισαντο can be translated to English as "they were brought" or "they were carried". The word implies that a group of people received some kind of object or item, but it does not specify what that object was. The context of the sentence would be necessary to determine the exact meaning of the word.
