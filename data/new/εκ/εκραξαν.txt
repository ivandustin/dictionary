Word: εκραξαν

Etymology: The word εκραξαν comes from the Greek verb κράζω (krázo), which means "to shout" or "to cry out". The prefix εκ- (ek-) in this case means "out", so εκραξαν can be translated as "they shouted out" or "they cried out".

Grammar: εκραξαν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb κράζω (krázo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "they") is performing the action.
