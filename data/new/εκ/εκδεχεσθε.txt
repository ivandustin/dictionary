Word: εκδεχεσθε

Etymology:
The word εκδεχεσθε comes from the Greek verb εκδέχομαι (ekdéchomai), which means "to wait for" or "to expect". It is derived from the prefix εκ- (ek-), meaning "out of" or "from", and the verb δέχομαι (déchomai), meaning "to receive" or "to accept".

Grammar:
εκδεχεσθε is a second person plural present middle/passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εσθε (-esthe) to the stem εκδεχ- (ekdech-). The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the receiver and the object of the action, and the imperative mood expresses a command or request.

Description:
εκδεχεσθε is a formal and polite way of telling someone to wait or to expect something. It is often used in official announcements, invitations, or instructions. The word implies a sense of anticipation and readiness, as if the thing being waited for is important or significant. In English, it can be translated as "please wait" or "please be patient".
