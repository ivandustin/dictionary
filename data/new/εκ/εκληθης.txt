Word: εκληθης

Etymology:
The word εκληθης is a Greek word that comes from the verb καλέω (kaleo), which means "to call" or "to summon". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκληθης can be translated as "called out" or "summoned".

Grammar:
εκληθης is a second-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb καλέω (kaleo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. Therefore, εκληθης can be translated as "you were called" or "you were summoned".
