Word: εκλεψαν

Etymology: εκλεψαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κλέπτω (klepto), which means "to steal". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκλεψαν can be translated as "they stole" or "they took away".

Grammar: εκλεψαν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb κλέπτω (klepto). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (in this case, "they") performed the action of stealing.
