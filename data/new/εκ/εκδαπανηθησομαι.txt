Word: εκδαπανηθησομαι

Etymology:
The word εκδαπανηθησομαι is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix εκ- (meaning "out of" or "from"), the verb δαπανάω (meaning "to spend"), and the reflexive suffix -ηθη- (indicating that the action is performed on oneself). Therefore, the word εκδαπανηθησομαι means "I will spend (money) on myself" or "I will squander (money) on myself".

The verb is also in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (in this case, "I") will receive the action of the verb rather than performing it actively.
