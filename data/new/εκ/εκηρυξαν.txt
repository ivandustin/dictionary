Word: εκηρύξαν (ekirýxan)

Etymology: The word εκηρύξαν comes from the Greek verb κηρύσσω (kirýsso), which means "to proclaim" or "to announce". The prefix εκ- (ek-) means "out of" or "from", so εκηρύξαν can be translated as "they proclaimed" or "they announced".

Grammar: εκηρύξαν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb κηρύσσω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject (in this case, "they") is performing the action of proclaiming or announcing.

Description: εκηρύξαν is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Acts (Acts 13:5). It is used to describe the actions of Paul and Barnabas as they traveled through Cyprus, proclaiming the word of God in the synagogues. The word carries a sense of urgency and importance, as it describes the act of making a public announcement or proclamation.
