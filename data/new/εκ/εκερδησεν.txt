Word: εκερδησεν

Etymology: The word εκερδησεν comes from the Greek verb κερδίζω (kerdizo), which means "to gain, to profit". The prefix εκ (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκερδησεν can be translated as "he/she/it gained" or "he/she/it profited".

Grammar: εκερδησεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb κερδίζω (kerdizo). In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, aspect, voice, and person/number of the subject. The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood is used to make a statement or ask a question. The active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description: εκερδησεν is a word that describes a past action of gaining or profiting. Without any context, it is impossible to know who or what gained or profited. However, the form of the word indicates that the subject was third person singular, so it could refer to he, she, or it. The word can be used in various contexts, such as business, finance, or personal relationships, to describe a positive outcome or benefit.
