Word: εκτισθη

Etymology: The word εκτισθη comes from the Greek verb "κτίζω" (ktizo), which means "to create" or "to build". The prefix "εκ" (ek) means "out of" or "from", so εκτισθη can be translated as "was created" or "was built".

Grammar: εκτισθη is a passive verb in the aorist tense, third person singular. It is formed by adding the passive ending "-θη" to the stem "κτισ-". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past.
