Word: εκατονταρχου

Etymology: The word εκατονταρχου (ekatontarchou) comes from the Greek words εκατόν (ekatón) meaning "hundred" and αρχή (archí) meaning "ruler" or "commander". Therefore, εκατονταρχου literally means "ruler of a hundred".

Grammar: εκατονταρχου is a noun in the singular form. In Greek, nouns have gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and case (nominative, genitive, accusative, etc.). The word εκατονταρχου is masculine and in the genitive case, which is used to show possession or relationship.

Description: In ancient Greece, εκατονταρχου referred to a military officer who commanded a hundred soldiers. The position was similar to that of a modern-day captain. The term was also used in the New Testament of the Bible to refer to a Roman centurion, a high-ranking officer in the Roman army. Today, the word εκατονταρχου is rarely used in modern Greek, except in historical or military contexts.
