The word εκαθαρισθησαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word καθαρίζω (katharizo), which means "to cleanse" or "to purify". The prefix εκα (eka) means "they were", so the word εκαθαρισθησαν means "they were cleansed" or "they were purified".

Description:
εκαθαρισθησαν is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John 15:3. In this passage, Jesus tells his disciples, "You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you." The word "clean" in this passage is translated from the Greek word καθαρός (katharos), which is related to the root word καθαρίζω (katharizo) from which εκαθαρισθησαν is derived. The use of the word εκαθαρισθησαν emphasizes that the disciples were not just clean, but that they had been cleansed or purified by the word of Jesus.
