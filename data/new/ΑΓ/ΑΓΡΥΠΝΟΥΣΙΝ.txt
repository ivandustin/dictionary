Etymology: The word "αγρυπνούσιν" comes from the Greek verb "αγρυπνώ" (agrypnó), which means "to stay awake" or "to be sleepless". It is derived from the combination of the prefix "α-" (a-), meaning "not", and the verb "γρυπνώ" (grypnó), meaning "to be awake".

Grammar: "αγρυπνούσιν" is the present tense, third person plural form of the verb "αγρυπνώ" (agrypnó). In Greek grammar, verbs change their endings to indicate the subject and tense. The "-ούσιν" (-oúsin) ending indicates that the subject is third person plural (they) and the action is happening in the present.
