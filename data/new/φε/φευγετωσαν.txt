The word "φευγετωσαν" is a Greek verb in the present imperative active form. It is derived from the root verb "φεύγω" which means "to flee" or "to escape". The present imperative active form is used to give commands or orders in the present tense. 

The word can be broken down into two parts: "φεύγω" and "-τωσαν". The suffix "-τωσαν" is added to the root verb to form the present imperative active form. 

In English, "φευγετωσαν" can be translated as "let them flee" or "let them escape". It is often used in a military or urgent context to give a command to a group of people to quickly flee or escape from a dangerous situation.
