Sorry, I cannot define the word "φευγε" as it is not a valid Greek word. It seems to be a misspelling of the Greek verb "φεύγει" (fevgei) which means "he/she/it flees/escapes". 

Etymology: The verb "φεύγει" comes from the ancient Greek word "φεύγω" (fevgo) which means "I flee/escape". 

Grammar: "φεύγει" is a present tense, indicative mood, third person singular form of the verb. 

Description: The verb "φεύγει" is commonly used in Greek to describe someone or something that is running away or escaping from a situation or danger. It can also be used metaphorically to describe avoiding or evading a responsibility or obligation.
