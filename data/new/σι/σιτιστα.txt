Word: σιτιστα

Etymology:
The word σιτιστα comes from the Greek word σιτίζω (sitizo), which means "to feed" or "to nourish". The suffix -ιστα (-ista) is a feminine suffix used to form nouns indicating a person who practices a certain profession or activity. Therefore, σιτιστα can be translated as "a female feeder" or "a female nourisher".

In Greek, σιτιστα is a feminine noun in the singular form. It belongs to the first declension, which means that its ending changes depending on its grammatical function in a sentence. For example, in the nominative case (subject of a sentence), it is σιτιστα, but in the accusative case (direct object of a sentence), it is σιτιστη.
