σιλωαμ (Silōam) is a Greek word that comes from the Hebrew word שִׁלֹּחַ (Shiloach), which means "sent" or "sending forth". In the Bible, Siloam is the name of a pool in Jerusalem where Jesus healed a blind man (John 9:1-11). 

In terms of grammar, σιλωαμ is a proper noun and is typically capitalized in English translations of the Bible. 

Description-wise, Siloam was a pool located in the southeastern part of Jerusalem, near the ancient City of David. It was fed by the Gihon Spring and was used for ritual purification by Jewish worshippers. Today, the site of the pool is a popular tourist attraction and is believed to be the same location mentioned in the Bible.
