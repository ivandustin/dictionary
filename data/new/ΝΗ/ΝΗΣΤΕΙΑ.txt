Etymology: The word "νηστεία" (nēsteia) comes from the Greek verb "νηστεύω" (nēsteuō), which means "to fast" or "to abstain from food." It is derived from the noun "νῆσος" (nēsos), meaning "island," possibly because fasting was associated with isolation or seclusion.

Grammar: "Νηστεία" is a feminine noun in Greek. It belongs to the first declension and has the plural form "νηστείες" (nēsteies).
