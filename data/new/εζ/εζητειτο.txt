Etymology: 
The word εζητειτο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb ζητέω (zeteo), which means "to seek" or "to search for". The verb ζητέω comes from the ancient Greek word ζήτημα (zitima), which means "a question" or "an inquiry".

The imperfect tense indicates an ongoing or repeated action in the past, while the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description:

The middle/passive voice suggests that the subject was both seeking and being sought after, or that the action of seeking was being done to the subject.
