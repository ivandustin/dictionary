The word "εζωννυες" (ezonnyes) is a Greek verb in the present tense, third person plural form. It comes from the root word "ζωννυμι" (zonnumi), which means "to gird" or "to fasten with a belt." 

In ancient Greece, soldiers would wear a belt or girdle called an "εζωνη" (ezonē) to hold their weapons and armor in place. The verb "εζωννυες" (ezonnyes) would be used to describe the act of soldiers putting on their belts or girdles before battle. 

In modern Greek, the verb "εζωννυες" (ezonnyes) is rarely used and is considered archaic.
