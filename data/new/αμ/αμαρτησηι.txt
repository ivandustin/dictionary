I'm sorry, but the word "αμαρτησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "αμαρτία" (amartia), which means "sin" in English. 

Etymology: The word "αμαρτία" comes from the Greek verb "αμαρτάνω" (amartano), which means "to miss the mark" or "to err". 

Grammar: "αμαρτία" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined like this: 

Singular: η αμαρτία (i amartia) 
Plural: οι αμαρτίες (i amarties) 

Description: "αμαρτία" is a term used in Greek Orthodox theology to refer to any action or thought that goes against God's will. It is considered a spiritual disease that separates humans from God and can only be cured through repentance and forgiveness.
