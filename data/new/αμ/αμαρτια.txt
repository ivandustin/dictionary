Description: αμαρτία is a term used in Christianity to refer to the concept of sin. It is often defined as an act or thought that goes against God's will or commandments. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe a wide range of sins, from small mistakes to more serious offenses. The concept of αμαρτία is central to Christian theology, as it is believed that all humans are born with a tendency to sin and that only through faith in Jesus Christ can one be saved from the consequences of sin.
