I'm sorry, but the word "αμαρτηι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "αμαρτία" (amartia), which means "sin" in English. 

Etymology: The word "αμαρτία" comes from the Greek verb "αμαρτάνω" (amartano), which means "to miss the mark" or "to err". 

Grammar: "αμαρτία" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined as follows: 

Singular: η αμαρτία (i amartia) 
Plural: οι αμαρτίες (oi amarties) 

Description: "αμαρτία" is a term used in Christian theology to refer to the act of violating God's will or commandments. It is often associated with the concept of original sin and the need for redemption.
