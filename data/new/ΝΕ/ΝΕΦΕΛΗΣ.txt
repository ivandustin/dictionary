Description: "Νεφελης" is a Greek word that translates to "cloud" in English. It refers to a visible mass of condensed water vapor floating in the atmosphere. Clouds play a crucial role in weather patterns and can vary in shape, size, and altitude. They are formed through the process of condensation when warm air rises and cools, causing water vapor to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. Clouds can have different types and are often used as a metaphorical symbol in literature and art.
