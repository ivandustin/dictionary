Description: "Τελώνων" refers to a group of tax collectors or customs officers. In ancient Greece, they were responsible for collecting taxes and duties on imported goods. They were often seen as corrupt and dishonest, as they had the power to extort money from merchants. In the New Testament of the Bible, there is a famous story about a tax collector named Matthew (also known as Levi), who became one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ.
