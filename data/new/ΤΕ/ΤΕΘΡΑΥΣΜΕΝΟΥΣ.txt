Etymology: The word "τεθραυσμένους" comes from the Greek verb "θραύω" (thraúo), which means "to break" or "to shatter." The prefix "τε-" (te-) indicates a perfective aspect, indicating completion or finality. The suffix "-μένος" (-menos) is a participle ending, indicating a passive voice and a present tense. Therefore, "τεθραυσμένους" can be translated as "having been broken" or "being shattered."

Grammar: "τεθραυσμένους" is the masculine accusative plural form of the participle "τεθραυσμένος" (tehrausmenos). In Greek grammar, participles are verbal adjectives that can modify nouns or function as verbs. The masculine gender indicates that the noun being modified is masculine, while the accusative case indicates that the noun is the direct object of the verb.
