Grammar: "πληροφορηθεί" is a passive verb in the aorist tense, which means that the subject receives the action of being informed. 

Description: The verb "πληροφορηθεί" is commonly used in everyday Greek language to express the idea of being informed or receiving information about something. It can be used in various contexts, such as in news reports, conversations, or official documents.
