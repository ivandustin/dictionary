Word: πλησθεις

Etymology:
The word πλησθεις (plēstheis) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πλήθω (plēthō), which means "to fill" or "to be full." The suffix -εις (-eis) is a second-person singular ending, which means that the word is addressing someone directly.

Grammar:
πλησθεις is a second-person singular aorist passive participle of the verb πληθω (plēthō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. The participle form of the verb is used to modify a noun or pronoun, and in this case, it is addressing the second-person singular "you."

Description:
The word πλησθεις can be translated to mean "you were filled" or "you have been filled." It is often used in a spiritual or metaphorical sense, such as being filled with the Holy Spirit or being filled with joy. In the New Testament, it is used in Ephesians 5:18, which says, "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit."
