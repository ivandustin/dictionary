πλανωμενον can be translated as "the one who is wandering" or "the one who is roaming". It is often used in the New Testament to describe someone who is lost or astray, both physically and spiritually. In Matthew 18:12, Jesus tells the parable of the lost sheep, saying "What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray (πλανωμενον), does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?"
