Word: πλανηται

Etymology:
The word πλανηται (planetai) is derived from the Greek word πλανήτης (planetes), which means "wanderer" or "wandering star". In ancient Greek astronomy, the term was used to describe the seven visible planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Sun, and the Moon.

Grammar:
πλανηται is a plural noun in Greek. It is the nominative form of the word, which means it is used as the subject of a sentence. The word can be declined in different cases, such as genitive, dative, and accusative, depending on its function in a sentence.

Description:
πλανηται refers to the planets in our solar system. In modern astronomy, the term is used to describe any celestial body that orbits a star, is not a star itself, and is large enough to have become rounded by its own gravity. The word is commonly used in scientific contexts, such as in discussions of planetary formation, planetary orbits, and planetary atmospheres.
