Word: πληροφορεισθω

Etymology:
The word πληροφορεισθω comes from the Greek root words πλήρης (pléris), meaning "full" or "complete," and φέρω (phérō), meaning "to carry" or "to bear." The suffix -εισθω (-eisthō) is a passive verb ending, indicating that the word is in the passive voice.

Grammar:

The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action of the verb, rather than performing it.
