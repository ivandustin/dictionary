I'm sorry, but the word "πληγηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling or a non-standard variation of the word "πληγή" (pligí), which means "wound" or "injury". 

Etymology: The word "πληγή" comes from the ancient Greek verb "πλήσσω" (plísso), which means "to strike" or "to hit". 

Grammar: "Πληγή" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "Πληγή" refers to a physical injury or wound caused by a blow, a cut, or any other type of trauma. It can also be used metaphorically to describe emotional or psychological pain.
