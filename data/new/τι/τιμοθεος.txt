τιμοθεος (timothéos) is a Greek name composed of two elements: τιμή (timé), meaning "honor" or "respect," and θεός (theos), meaning "god." Therefore, the name τιμοθεος can be translated as "honoring God" or "one who honors God." 

In terms of grammar, τιμοθεος is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be used as a proper noun, as it is a name. 

In the Bible, Timothy is a well-known figure who was a companion of the apostle Paul and a leader in the early Christian church. He is often referred to as "Timothy" in English translations of the Bible, but his name in Greek is τιμόθεος (timótheos).
