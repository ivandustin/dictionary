Word: μνησθηναι

Etymology:
The word μνησθηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word μνημονεύω (mnēmoneuō), which means "to remember." The verb μνησθηναι is in the aorist tense, which indicates a past action that is viewed as a single event.

Grammar:
μνησθηναι is a second-person singular aorist passive imperative verb in Greek. This means that it is a command directed at one person (you), in the past tense, and in the passive voice. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action themselves.

Description:
μνησθηναι is a command to remember something that has already happened. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context, such as in the Bible, where it is used to urge people to remember God's actions and promises. In modern Greek, it is also used in everyday speech to mean "remember" or "don't forget."
