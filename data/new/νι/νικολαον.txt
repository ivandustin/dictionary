Sorry, I cannot provide a definition for the word "νικολαον" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling or a variation of the name "Νικόλαος" (Nikolaos) which means "victorious people" in Greek. 

Etymology: The name Nikolaos is derived from the Greek words "nikē" meaning "victory" and "laos" meaning "people".

Grammar: Nikolaos is a masculine Greek name and is declined in the same way as other Greek nouns and adjectives.

Description: Nikolaos is a popular name in Greece and is often given to boys. It is associated with the Christian saint Saint Nicholas, who is known for his generosity and kindness.
