The word "νικοπολιν" (nikopolin) is a Greek noun that means "city of victory". It is derived from the Greek words "νίκη" (nike), meaning "victory", and "πόλις" (polis), meaning "city". 

In terms of grammar, "νικοπολιν" is in the accusative case, which is used to indicate the direct object of a verb. 

In ancient times, there were several cities in the Greek world that were named "Nikopolis" or "Nikopolis" (the Latinized version of the same name), including one in Epirus founded by Octavian (later known as Augustus) after his victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Another famous Nikopolis was founded by the Roman Emperor Trajan in what is now Bulgaria. 

Today, "νικοπολιν" is not commonly used in modern Greek, but it may still be encountered in historical or literary contexts.
