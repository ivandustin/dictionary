μητε (mēte) is a conjunction in ancient Greek that means "nor" or "neither". It is often used in negative sentences to connect two negative clauses. 

Etymology: μητε comes from the combination of the negative particle μή (mē) and the conjunction τε (te), which means "and" or "also". 

Grammar: μητε is a coordinating conjunction, which means it connects two clauses of equal importance. It is always used in pairs with another negative word, such as οὐ (ou) or μή (mē), to create a negative sentence. 

Description: μητε is commonly used in ancient Greek literature, particularly in epic poetry such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. It is also found in other genres, such as tragedy and philosophy. In modern Greek, the equivalent conjunction is ούτε (oute).
