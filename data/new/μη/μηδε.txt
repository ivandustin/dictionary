μηδε (mēde) is a Greek conjunction that means "nor" or "neither". It is composed of two negative particles, μή (mē) meaning "not" and δέ (de) meaning "but" or "and". In Greek grammar, μηδε is used to connect two negative clauses or phrases, indicating that neither of them is true. For example, "I don't like coffee, nor do I like tea" can be translated as "Δεν μου αρέσει ο καφές, μηδε ο τσάι".
