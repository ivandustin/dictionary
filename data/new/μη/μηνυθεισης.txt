Word: μηνυθεισης

Etymology:
The word μηνυθεισης is derived from the Greek verb μηνύω (mēnúō), which means "to accuse" or "to denounce". The suffix -της (-tēs) is added to the verb stem to form a noun indicating the agent or doer of the action, hence μηνυθεισης means "the one who accuses" or "the accuser".

Grammar:
μηνυθεισης is a feminine noun in the genitive case, which means it is used to indicate possession or relationship to another noun or pronoun in a sentence. In Greek, the genitive case is often used to express the object of a verb or preposition, or to indicate the source or origin of something.

Description:
μηνυθεισης is a rare word in modern Greek, but it appears in ancient Greek literature, particularly in legal and political contexts. It is often used to refer to someone who brings a legal accusation or charge against another person, or to describe the act of making such an accusation. In some cases, it can also be used more broadly to refer to someone who speaks out against wrongdoing or injustice.
