μηδεν (mēden) is a Greek word that means "nothing" or "none". It is derived from the combination of μή (mē), which means "not", and εἷς (heis), which means "one". In terms of grammar, μηδεν is a pronoun that is used to indicate the absence of something or someone. It can also be used as an adverb to modify verbs or adjectives. In Greek philosophy, the concept of μηδέν άγαν (mēden agan) or "nothing in excess" was a central idea in the teachings of the philosopher Aristotle.
