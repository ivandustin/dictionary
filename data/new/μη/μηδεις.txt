μηδεις (mēdeis) is a Greek word that means "no one" or "nobody". It is derived from the negative particle μη (mē) and the word εἷς (heis), which means "one". In terms of grammar, μηδεις is a pronoun and is declined like a regular noun in Greek. It can be used as a subject, object, or possessive pronoun. In Greek mythology, the character Odysseus used the name "Nobody" (Οὖτις, Outis) as a pseudonym to trick the Cyclops Polyphemus.
