Etymology: The word "ατενίσαι" comes from the Greek verb "ατενίζω" (atenízo), which means "to gaze intently" or "to fix one's eyes upon". It is derived from the prefix "α-" (a-), which denotes negation or absence, and the verb "τείνω" (teíno), meaning "to stretch" or "to extend". Therefore, "ατενίσαι" can be understood as "not stretching one's eyes away" or "not diverting one's gaze".

Grammar: "ατενίσαι" is the aorist active infinitive form of the verb "ατενίζω" (atenízo). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a completed action in the past, without specifying its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb performs the action.

Description: "ατενίσαι" describes the act of gazing intently or fixing one's eyes upon something. It implies a focused and concentrated observation, often with a sense of curiosity, interest, or scrutiny.
