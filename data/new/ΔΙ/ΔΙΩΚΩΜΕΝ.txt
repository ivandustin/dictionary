Etymology: The word "διωκόμενος" (diokomenos) comes from the Greek verb "διώκω" (dioko), which means "to pursue" or "to chase". The suffix "-μενος" (-menos) is a participle ending that indicates the passive voice, so "διωκόμενος" can be translated as "being pursued" or "being chased".

Grammar: "Διωκόμενος" is a present passive participle in the masculine singular form. In Greek grammar, participles are verbal adjectives that can modify nouns or function as independent verbs. The present tense indicates that the action is happening at the same time as the main verb, and the passive voice indicates that the subject is receiving the action.

Description: "Διωκόμενος" describes someone or something that is currently being pursued or chased. It implies that the subject is actively being followed or hunted by someone or something.
