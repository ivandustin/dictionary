Etymology: The word "διωκωσιν" comes from the Greek verb "διώκω" (dióko), which means "to pursue" or "to chase". It is derived from the combination of the prefix "δι-" (di-), meaning "through" or "across", and the verb "ὀκνέω" (oknéo), meaning "to hesitate" or "to be reluctant".

Grammar: "διωκωσιν" is the third person plural present active subjunctive form of the verb "διώκω" (dióko). In Greek grammar, the subjunctive mood is used to express actions that are uncertain, potential, or hypothetical. The present tense indicates that the action is happening in the present time, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.
