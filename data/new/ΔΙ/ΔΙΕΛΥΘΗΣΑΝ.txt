Etymology: The word "διελυθήσαν" comes from the Greek verb "διαλύω" (dialýo), which means "to dissolve" or "to break up". It is formed by combining the prefix "δια-" (dia-), meaning "through" or "across", and the verb "λύω" (lýo), meaning "to loosen" or "to untie".

Grammar: "διελυθήσαν" is the third person plural, aorist passive indicative form of the verb "διαλύω" (dialýo). The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. The suffix "-σαν" (-san) is added to the stem of the verb to indicate the third person plural form.
