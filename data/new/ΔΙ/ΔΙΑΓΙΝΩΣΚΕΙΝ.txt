Etymology: The word "διαγινώσκειν" comes from the Greek verb "γινώσκω" (ginósko), which means "to know" or "to understand." The prefix "δια-" (dia-) adds the meaning of "through" or "across," giving the word "διαγινώσκειν" the sense of "to diagnose" or "to discern."

Grammar: "Διαγινώσκειν" is the present active infinitive form of the verb. In Greek, verbs are conjugated based on tense, mood, voice, and person. The present tense indicates an ongoing action, while the active voice suggests that the subject performs the action. The infinitive form is the base form of the verb, often used to express the concept of the verb without specifying the subject or tense.
