Etymology: The word "διανοητικός" (dianoitikós) comes from the Greek root "διάνοια" (diánoia), which means "thought" or "mind". The suffix "-ικός" (-ikós) is added to form an adjective, meaning "related to" or "pertaining to".

Grammar: "Διανοητικός" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if used to describe a feminine noun, it would change to "διανοητική" (dianoitikí), and if used to describe a plural noun, it would change to "διανοητικοί" (dianoitikoí) for masculine or "διανοητικές" (dianoitikés) for feminine.
