Etymology: The word "διαλογιζέσθαι" comes from the Greek verb "διαλογίζομαι" (dialogizomai), which means "to reason" or "to think through." It is derived from the combination of the prefix "δια-" (dia-), meaning "through," and the verb "λογίζομαι" (logizomai), meaning "to calculate" or "to reckon."

The present tense indicates an ongoing action, and the middle/passive voice suggests that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.
