Etymology: The word "διεκριθητε" comes from the Greek verb "διακρίνω" (diakríno), which means "to distinguish" or "to separate". It is formed by combining the prefix "δια-" (dia-), meaning "through" or "across", and the verb "κρίνω" (kríno), meaning "to judge" or "to decide".

Grammar: "διεκριθητε" is the second person plural, aorist tense, passive voice form of the verb "διακρίνω" (diakríno). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a past action that is viewed as a whole, without specifying its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: "διεκριθητε" can be translated as "you were distinguished" or "you were separated" in English. It implies that the subject (you) was set apart or recognized for a particular quality, achievement, or characteristic.
