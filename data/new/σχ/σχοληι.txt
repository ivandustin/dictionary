I'm sorry, but the word "σχοληι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that you meant to type "σχολή" which means "school" in English. 

Etymology: The word "σχολή" comes from the ancient Greek word "σχολή" which meant "leisure" or "free time". Over time, the meaning of the word shifted to refer to a place where people go to learn and study.

Grammar: "Σχολή" is a feminine noun in Greek and its plural form is "σχολές". It can be used with definite article "η σχολή" (the school) or indefinite article "μια σχολή" (a school).

Description: "Σχολή" refers to a place where students go to learn and study. It can refer to any level of education, from elementary school to university. In Greece, schools are typically organized into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education is compulsory and lasts for six years, while secondary education is divided into two cycles of three years each. Tertiary education includes universities and technical colleges.
