Word: φθεγγόμενοι

Etymology:
The word φθεγγόμενοι is a present participle form of the Greek verb φθέγγομαι (phthéngomai), which means "to utter a sound, to speak, to express oneself." The word is derived from the root φθεγγ-, which is related to the Greek word φωνή (phoné), meaning "voice" or "sound."

Grammar:
φθεγγόμενοι is a present participle form of the verb φθέγγομαι. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (ont-) to the present stem of the verb. The present stem of φθέγγομαι is φθεγγ-, so the present participle form is φθεγγόμενοι.
