Word: φθινοπωρινα

Etymology: The word φθινοπωρινα comes from the Greek words φθίνω (fthinó) meaning "to wane" or "to decline" and πόρος (póros) meaning "passage" or "season". Therefore, φθινοπωρινα literally means "of the autumn season" or "autumnal".

Grammar: φθινοπωρινα is an adjective in the feminine plural form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is feminine, the adjective must also be feminine. If the noun is plural, the adjective must also be plural. In this case, φθινοπωρινα modifies a feminine plural noun.
