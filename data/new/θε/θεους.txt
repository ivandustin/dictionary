Description:
Θεους is a word that refers to multiple gods or deities in Greek mythology. In ancient Greek religion, there were many gods and goddesses who were worshipped and believed to have control over various aspects of life, such as Zeus (god of thunder and lightning), Athena (goddess of wisdom and warfare), and Apollo (god of music, poetry, and prophecy).
