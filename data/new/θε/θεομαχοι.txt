The word "θεομαχοι" (theomachoi) is a Greek term that literally means "those who fight against the gods". It is derived from the combination of two Greek words: "θεός" (theos), meaning "god", and "μάχομαι" (machomai), meaning "to fight". 

In Greek mythology, the term was used to describe mortals who challenged or rebelled against the gods, such as Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans, or Icarus, who flew too close to the sun with wings made of feathers and wax. 

In terms of grammar, "θεομαχοι" is a plural noun in the nominative case. It can be translated into English as "god-fighters" or "those who fight against the gods". 

Overall, "θεομαχοι" is a term that is closely associated with Greek mythology and the concept of mortal rebellion against divine authority.
