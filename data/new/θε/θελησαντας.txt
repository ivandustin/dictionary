Word: θελησαντας

Etymology: θελησαντας is a Greek word that comes from the verb θέλω (thélo), which means "to will" or "to want". The suffix -αντας (-antas) is a participle ending that indicates past action, so θελησαντας means "having willed" or "having wanted".

Grammar: θελησαντας is the masculine accusative plural form of the participle θέλων (thélōn), which means "willing" or "wanting". It is used as an adjective to describe a noun in the accusative case, which is the direct object of the verb. For example, in the sentence "Οι θελησάντες πολέμησαν" (Oi thelisántes polémisan), which means "The ones who wanted fought", θελησαντας describes the subject of the sentence, "the ones who wanted", and agrees with it in gender (masculine), number (plural), and case (accusative).
