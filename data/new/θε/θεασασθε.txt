Word: θεασασθε

Etymology: θεασασθε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word θεάομαι (theáomai), which means "to see, to behold, to observe." The suffix -σασθε (-sasthe) is a second person plural middle voice ending, indicating that the action is being performed by the subject upon themselves.

Grammar: θεασασθε is a second person plural middle voice verb in the aorist tense. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action upon themselves, rather than having the action done to them by someone else.

Description: θεασασθε can be translated as "behold yourselves" or "observe yourselves." It is a command directed at a group of people, urging them to take a closer look at themselves and their actions. The middle voice emphasizes that the responsibility for self-reflection and self-improvement lies with the individual, rather than with external forces.
