Description: θερισον is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 13, verse 30). In this passage, Jesus tells a parable about a farmer who sows wheat in his field, but an enemy comes and sows weeds among the wheat. When the wheat and weeds begin to grow together, the farmer's servants ask if they should pull up the weeds, but the farmer tells them to wait until the harvest. Then he says to them, "θερισον πρῶτον τὰ ζιζάνια καὶ δήσατε αὐτὰ εἰς δέσμας πρὸς τὸ κατακαῦσαι αὐτά, τὸν δὲ σῖτον συναγάγετε εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην μου" (therison proton ta zizania kai desate auta eis desmas pros to katakaysai auta, ton de siton synagagete eis ten apotheken mou), which means "First gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn." 

Overall, θερισον is a word that is associated with the idea of harvesting or reaping, and it is used in a biblical parable to illustrate a moral lesson about patience and judgment.
