Word: θεωρουσιν

Etymology: θεωρουσιν is a present active indicative form of the Greek verb θεωρέω (theoreo), which means "to observe" or "to contemplate". The word comes from the root θεωρ- (theor-), which means "to look at" or "to watch".

Grammar: θεωρουσιν is a third-person plural present active indicative form of θεωρέω. This means that it is describing an action that is currently happening in the present, and that the subject of the sentence is a group of people (since it is plural). 

Description: θεωρουσιν can be translated to "they observe" or "they contemplate". It is often used in a philosophical or religious context, to describe the act of contemplating or observing the divine. In ancient Greek culture, the act of θεωρία (theoria) was highly valued, and involved the contemplation of the gods and their actions. Today, the word is still used in philosophical and religious discussions, as well as in academic contexts to describe the act of observing or studying something closely.
