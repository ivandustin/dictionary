τηλαυγως (tilaugos) is a Greek word that is composed of two parts: τηλε (tele), meaning "far" or "distant," and αυγω (augo), meaning "to shine" or "to radiate." Therefore, the word τηλαυγως can be translated as "radiating from afar" or "shining from a distance."

In terms of grammar, τηλαυγως is a masculine noun in the nominative singular form. It belongs to the third declension in Greek grammar, which means that its endings change depending on its grammatical function in a sentence.

In ancient Greek literature, τηλαυγως was often used to describe the radiance or brilliance of the sun, stars, or other celestial bodies. It was also used metaphorically to describe the radiance or brilliance of a person's character or reputation.
