τηνδε (pronounced "teen-deh") is a Greek demonstrative pronoun that means "this one" or "this thing". It is used to refer to something that is close to the speaker or to emphasize a particular object or idea. 

Etymology: τηνδε comes from the combination of the feminine definite article τήν (tēn) and the demonstrative pronoun δε (de). 

Grammar: τηνδε is declined like a regular feminine noun in the singular. In the plural, it is declined like the masculine and neuter demonstrative pronoun οἱδε (hoi-de) or ταῦτα (ta-oo-ta). 

Description: τηνδε is commonly used in Greek literature and speech to point out or emphasize a particular object or idea. It is often used in combination with other demonstrative pronouns or adjectives to provide additional emphasis or clarification.
