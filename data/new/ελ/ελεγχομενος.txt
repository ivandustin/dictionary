Word: ελεγχόμενος

Etymology: The word ελεγχόμενος comes from the Greek verb ελέγχω (eléncho), which means "to examine" or "to test". The suffix -μένος (-menos) is a passive participle ending, which means that the word ελεγχόμενος can be translated as "being examined" or "being tested".

Grammar: ελεγχόμενος is a masculine singular adjective in the nominative case. It agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if we want to say "the examined student", we would use the masculine singular nominative form ελεγχόμενος with the masculine singular nominative noun μαθητής (mathitis).

Description: ελεγχόμενος is an adjective that describes something or someone that is being examined or tested. It can be used in various contexts, such as in scientific experiments, medical tests, or academic evaluations. It implies a state of uncertainty or potential change, as the outcome of the examination or test is not yet known.
