I'm sorry, but the word "ελληνικηι" is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "ελληνική", which means "Greek" in English. 

Etymology: The word "ελληνική" comes from the Greek word "Έλληνες" (Ellines), which means "Greeks". 

Grammar: "Ελληνική" is an adjective in the feminine gender, singular form. It agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies. For example, "Ελληνική κουζίνα" (Elliniki kouzina) means "Greek cuisine", where "κουζίνα" (kouzina) is a feminine noun. 

Description: "Ελληνική" is a common word in the Greek language and is used to describe anything related to Greece or the Greek culture. It can be used to describe food, music, art, language, and more.
