Word: ελυετο

Etymology: ελυετο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb λύω (lyo), which means "to loosen" or "to untie". The verb λύω comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *leu- which means "to loosen, divide, cut apart".

Grammar: ελυετο is the third person singular, middle voice, imperfect tense of the verb λύω. In Greek, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. The imperfect tense is used to describe an ongoing or repeated action in the past.

Description: ελυετο can be translated as "he/she/it was loosening/untieing". It describes an ongoing or repeated action of loosening or untying something in the past. The middle voice indicates that the subject was both the one doing the action and the one affected by it.
