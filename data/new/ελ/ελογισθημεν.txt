Word: ελογισθημεν

Etymology:
The word ελογισθημεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word λογίζομαι (logizomai), which means "to reckon, count, or calculate." The word is formed by adding the prefix ε- (e-) to the stem λογισθ- (logisth-), which is the aorist passive form of λογίζομαι.

Grammar:
ελογισθημεν is the aorist passive form of the Greek verb λογίζομαι (logizomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description:
ελογισθημεν means "we were reckoned" or "we were counted" in English. The word is used in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the book of Romans, to describe how God counts believers as righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. The word emphasizes that this righteousness is not something that believers earn or achieve on their own, but rather it is a gift from God that is received by faith.
