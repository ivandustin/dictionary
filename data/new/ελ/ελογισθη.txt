Word: ελογισθη

Etymology: The word ελογισθη comes from the Greek verb λογίζομαι (logizomai), which means "to calculate" or "to reckon". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a past tense form, so ελογισθη means "was calculated" or "was reckoned".

Grammar: ελογισθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb λογίζομαι. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the thing being calculated or reckoned) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: ελογισθη is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Romans 4:3, where it is used to describe how Abraham's faith was "counted" or "credited" to him as righteousness. The word emphasizes the idea that Abraham's righteousness was not something he earned through his own efforts, but rather something that was given to him as a gift from God. In general, the word can be used to describe any situation where something is calculated or reckoned, whether it is a financial transaction, a moral judgment, or a theological concept.
