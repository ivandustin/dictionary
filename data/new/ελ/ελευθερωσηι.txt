I'm sorry, but the word "ελευθερωσηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "ελευθερώσει" (eleftherósei), which is the third person singular future tense of the verb "ελευθερώνω" (eleftheróno), meaning "to liberate" or "to set free". 

Etymology: The word "ελευθερώνω" comes from the ancient Greek word "ἐλευθερόω" (eleutheróo), which means "to make free" or "to set at liberty". It is derived from the adjective "ἐλεύθερος" (eleútheros), meaning "free" or "liberated".

Grammar: "Ελευθερώσει" is a verb form in the future tense, which indicates an action that will take place in the future. It is formed by adding the future tense suffix "-σει" to the stem of the verb "ελευθερώνω".

Description: The word "ελευθερώσει" is used in Greek to express the idea of someone or something being liberated or set free in the future. It can be used in various contexts, such as political, social, or personal liberation.
