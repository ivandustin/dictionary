Grammar: ελυθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb λύω (lyo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon.

Description: ελυθη can be translated to English as "was loosened" or "was untied". The word is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the healing of physical ailments, such as the untying of a woman who had been bent over for 18 years (Luke 13:16). It can also be used metaphorically to describe the release from spiritual or emotional burdens.
