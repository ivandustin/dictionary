Description:
In Christian theology, an archangel is an angel of high rank. In the Bible, there are only two archangels mentioned by name: Michael and Gabriel. However, in some traditions, there are seven archangels, including Michael and Gabriel, and others include additional archangels such as Raphael, Uriel, and others. Archangels are believed to have important roles in the spiritual realm, such as being messengers of God, protectors of humans, and leaders of other angels. The concept of archangels is also present in other religions and mythologies.
