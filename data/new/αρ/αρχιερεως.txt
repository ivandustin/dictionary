Etymology: The word αρχιερεύς (archiereus) comes from the Greek words αρχή (arche), meaning "beginning" or "origin," and ιερεύς (iereus), meaning "priest." Therefore, αρχιερεύς can be translated as "high priest" or "chief priest."

Grammar: αρχιερεύς is a masculine noun in the nominative case. In the genitive case, it becomes αρχιερέως (archiereos). In the plural form, it becomes αρχιερείς (archiereis).

Description: In ancient Greece, αρχιερεύς referred to the highest-ranking priest in a temple or religious organization.
