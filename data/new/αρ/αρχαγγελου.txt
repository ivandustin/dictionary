Word: αρχαγγελου

Etymology: The word αρχαγγελου comes from the Greek words αρχή (arche) meaning "beginning" or "first" and αγγελος (angelos) meaning "messenger" or "angel". Therefore, αρχαγγελου can be translated as "chief angel" or "first angel".

Grammar: αρχαγγελου is a noun in the genitive case, which is used to show possession or relationship. In this case, it is used to describe the angels that hold a higher rank than the regular angels.
