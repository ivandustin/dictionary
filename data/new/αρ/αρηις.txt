I'm sorry, but the word "αρηις" is not a valid Greek word. It is possible that you meant to type "Αρης" which is the Greek name for the god of war, Ares. 

Etymology: The name "Ares" is of uncertain origin, but it is believed to be derived from the Greek word "arēs" which means "bane, ruin, curse". 

Grammar: "Αρης" is a masculine noun in Greek and is declined as follows: 

Singular: ο Αρης (o Aris) - the nominative form, Αρη (Ari) - the genitive form, Αρη (Ari) - the accusative form. 

Plural: οι Αρες (oi Ares) - the nominative form, Αρων (Aron) - the genitive form, Αρες (Ares) - the accusative form. 

Description: In Greek mythology, Ares is the son of Zeus and Hera and is the god of war, violence, and bloodshed. He is often depicted as a fierce and brutal warrior, and is associated with the Roman god Mars. Ares was not well-liked by the other gods, who saw him as a troublemaker and a bully. Despite this, he was still worshipped by the ancient Greeks, particularly in the city of Sparta.
