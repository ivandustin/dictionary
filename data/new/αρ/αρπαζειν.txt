The word "αρπαζειν" (harpa-zein) is a Greek verb that means "to snatch" or "to seize". It comes from the root word "ἁρπάζω" (harpazo), which means "to seize" or "to carry off". In grammar, it is a present active infinitive verb, which means it is the unconjugated form of the verb that expresses the action of snatching or seizing in the present tense. The word is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the sudden and unexpected taking away of believers by God.
