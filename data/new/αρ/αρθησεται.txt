Word: αρθησεται

Etymology: The word αρθησεται is a conjugated form of the Greek verb αρθήσω (arthíso), which means "I will raise" or "I will lift up". The verb comes from the root word αρθρον (árthron), which means "joint" or "articulation".

Grammar: αρθησεται is a third-person singular future passive indicative form of the verb αρθήσω. It is formed by adding the suffix -ησεται to the stem αρθήσ-. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence will receive the action of the verb, rather than performing the action themselves.

Description: αρθησεται can be translated to English as "he/she/it will be raised/lifted up". The word is often used in a religious or spiritual context, referring to the idea of being lifted up to a higher plane of existence or enlightenment. It can also be used in a more literal sense, such as lifting an object or a person up from the ground.
