Word: ηδυνηθητε

Etymology:
The word ηδυνηθητε is a conjugated form of the Greek verb "ἰσχύω" (ischýō), which means "to be strong, to prevail, to have power". The prefix "η-" indicates the past tense, and the suffix "-θη-" indicates the passive voice. Therefore, ηδυνηθητε means "you were made strong" or "you were empowered".

Grammar:
ηδυνηθητε is the second person plural, past passive indicative form of the verb ἰσχύω. It is formed by adding the prefix η- to the stem ισχυν-, which is the aorist passive stem of the verb. The ending -θητε indicates the second person plural, and the tense is past.
