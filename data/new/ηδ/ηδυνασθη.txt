Word: ηδυνασθη

Etymology:
The word ηδυνασθη is derived from the Greek verb "ἰσχύω" (ischýō), which means "to be able, to have power". The prefix "ἡδύς" (hēdýs) means "sweet, pleasant", so ηδυνασθη can be translated as "to be able sweetly, to have sweet power".

Grammar:
ηδυνασθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb ἰσχύω (ischýō). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description:
ηδυνασθη can be translated as "was able" or "had the power". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the power of God or the ability of Jesus to perform miracles. For example, in Matthew 9:8, it is written: "When the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to human beings." Here, the word "authority" is translated from ηδυνασθη.
