The word "ηλπικεν" (elpiken) is the third person singular perfect active indicative form of the Greek verb "ελπίζω" (elpizo), which means "to hope" or "to have hope". 

Etymology: The word "ελπίζω" comes from the ancient Greek noun "ελπίς" (elpis), which means "hope" or "expectation". 

Grammar: "ηλπικεν" is a verb form that indicates a completed action in the past. The third person singular form means that the subject of the sentence is a singular third person (he, she, or it) who performed the action. The active voice indicates that the subject performed the action, rather than receiving it. 

Description: "ηλπικεν" can be translated as "he/she/it has hoped" or "he/she/it hoped". It is a relatively uncommon form in modern Greek, as the present tense form "ελπίζω" is more commonly used. However, the perfect tense is still used in formal or literary contexts.
