Word: ηλπικατε

Etymology: ηλπικατε is a conjugated form of the Greek verb "ελπίζω" (elpizo), which means "to hope" or "to have hope". The verb comes from the noun "ελπίς" (elpis), which means "hope" or "expectation".

Grammar: ηλπικατε is the second person plural of the perfect tense in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix "-κα-" to the stem of the verb and then adding the appropriate personal ending. In this case, the stem is "ελπισ-", and the personal ending is "-ατε", which indicates that the subject is "you" (plural).

Description: ηλπικατε is a verb form that indicates that a group of people (you, plural) have completed an action of hoping or having hope in the past. It is often used in Greek to express a sense of optimism or expectation for the future, and can be translated into English as "you have hoped" or "you have had hope".
