Word: ηλευθερώσεν

Etymology: ηλευθερώσεν is the aorist tense of the Greek verb ηλευθερόω (eleutheróo), which means "to set free" or "to liberate". The word comes from the combination of the prefix ηλευθερο- (eleuthero-), meaning "free", and the verb ω (o), which is a common ending for Greek verbs.

Grammar: ηλευθερώσεν is a third person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb (he/she/it) performed the action. In this case, the subject is not specified, so it could refer to any third person singular subject (e.g. he, she, it).
