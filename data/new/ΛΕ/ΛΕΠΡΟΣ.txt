Etymology: The word "λεπρός" (lepros) comes from the Greek language. It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *lep- meaning "to peel" or "to scale off". 

Grammar: In Greek, "λεπρός" is an adjective that is used to describe someone or something as being leprous or having leprosy. It can be used in both masculine and feminine forms, and it can also be declined to match the case, number, and gender of the noun it modifies.

Description: "Λεπρός" is a term used to describe a person or thing that has leprosy, a chronic infectious disease that affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes. Historically, leprosy was a feared and stigmatized condition, and those who were afflicted with it were often isolated from society. Today, leprosy is treatable with antibiotics, and the social stigma associated with the disease has decreased significantly.
