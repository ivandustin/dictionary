They were the second highest social class in Sparta, below the Spartiates (full Spartan citizens) but above the Perioikoi (free non-citizens) and the Helots (serfs). The λευείς were free men who were required to serve in the Spartan military and were known for their bravery and discipline. They played a crucial role in the military success of Sparta.
