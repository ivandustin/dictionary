Word: υιοθεσία (Greek)

Etymology: The word υιοθεσία comes from the combination of two Greek words, υιός (uios) meaning "son" and θέσις (thesis) meaning "placing". Therefore, υιοθεσία literally means "placing a son".

Grammar: υιοθεσία is a feminine noun in Greek. Its plural form is υιοθεσίες (uiosthesies).

Description: υιοθεσία refers to the legal process of adopting a child and making them legally and socially a part of one's family. In ancient Greece, adoption was a common practice, especially for families without male heirs. Today, υιοθεσία is still a common practice in Greece and is regulated by the Greek Civil Code. The process involves a court hearing and the consent of both the biological parents and the child (if they are over 12 years old). Once the adoption is finalized, the child takes on the surname of the adoptive family and is considered legally and socially their child.
