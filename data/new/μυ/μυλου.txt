I'm sorry, but the word "μυλου" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "μύλος" (mýlos), which means "mill" in English. 

Etymology: The word "μύλος" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *melh₂- ("to grind"), which also gave rise to the English words "meal" and "millstone".

Grammar: "Μύλος" is a masculine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "μύλοι" (mýloi).

Description: A "μύλος" is a machine that grinds grains or other materials into flour or powder. It typically consists of two circular stones or metal plates, one of which rotates to crush the material. In ancient Greece, mills were powered by hand, animals, or water, and were used for a variety of purposes, including grinding wheat, barley, and other crops, as well as crushing olives for oil. Today, mills are still used in some traditional societies, but most industrialized countries rely on modern milling techniques.
