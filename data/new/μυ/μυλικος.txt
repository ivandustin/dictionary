Word: μυλικός

Etymology:
The word μυλικός (mylikos) comes from the Greek word μύλος (mylos), which means "mill". The suffix -ικός (-ikos) is used to form adjectives, indicating that something is related to or characteristic of the noun it is attached to. Therefore, μυλικός means "related to or characteristic of a mill".

Grammar:
μυλικός is an adjective in the masculine gender, singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, if we want to describe a feminine noun, we would use the feminine form of the adjective, which is μυλική (myliki).

Description:
μυλικός can be used to describe anything related to a mill, such as the miller, the millstone, or the flour produced by the mill. It can also be used metaphorically to describe something that is grinding or crushing, as in "μυλικός πόνος" (mylikos ponos), which means "crushing pain".
