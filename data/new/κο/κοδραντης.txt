Word: κοδραντης

Etymology:
The word κοδραντης (kodrantes) is derived from the Latin word "quadrans," which means "a quarter." It was a small Roman coin that was worth one-quarter of an as. The word was later adopted by the Greeks and used to refer to a small amount of money.

Grammar:
In Greek, κοδραντης is a masculine noun of the first declension. Its nominative singular form is κοδραντης, and its genitive singular form is κοδραντου. The word is declined like other first-declension nouns, such as θεατρον (theater) and ανηρ (man).

Description:
In modern Greek, κοδραντης is not commonly used to refer to a specific coin or amount of money. Instead, it is used in idiomatic expressions to mean a small amount or a small change. For example, if someone owes you a small amount of money, you might say "δωσε μου το κοδραντη" (give me the small change). The word can also be used to describe something that is small or insignificant.
