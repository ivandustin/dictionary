Word: κοκκον

Etymology:
The word κοκκον (kokkon) is derived from the Greek word κόκκος (kokkos), which means "seed" or "grain". It is believed to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European root *gʷeh₂- ("to grow, become strong").

Grammar:
In Greek, κοκκον is a masculine noun in the singular form. Its nominative case is κοκκον, and its genitive case is κοκκου. It belongs to the second declension of Greek nouns.

Description:
