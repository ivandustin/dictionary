Etymology: 
The word "ομολογουμενως" (omologoumenos) is derived from the Greek verb "ομολογέω" (omologeo), which means "to confess" or "to acknowledge". The suffix "-ουμεν-" (-oumen-) is a present participle form, indicating ongoing action. Therefore, "ομολογουμενως" can be translated as "confessing" or "acknowledging".

Grammar:
"ομολογουμενως" is an adverb in Greek, which means that it modifies the verb in a sentence. It is often used to express agreement or confirmation, similar to the English adverb "indeed". It can also be used to emphasize the truthfulness or sincerity of a statement.

Description:
