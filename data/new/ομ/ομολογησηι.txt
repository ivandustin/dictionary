I'm sorry, but the word "ομολογησηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "ομολογία" (omologia), which means "confession" or "acknowledgment". 

Etymology: The word "ομολογία" comes from the Greek verb "ομολογώ" (omologo), which means "to confess" or "to acknowledge". It is composed of two parts: "ομο-" (omo-), which means "same" or "similar", and "-λογία" (-logia), which means "word" or "speech".

Grammar: "Ομολογία" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "ομολογίες" (omologies).

Description: "Ομολογία" can refer to a confession of guilt or wrongdoing, a statement of agreement or admission, or a profession of faith or belief. It is a common word in both religious and legal contexts.
