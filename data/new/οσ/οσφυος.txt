Word: οσφυος

Etymology:
The word οσφυος (osphyos) comes from the Ancient Greek word ὀσφύς (osphys), which means "loin" or "lower back". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₃seb-, which means "loin" or "hip".

Grammar:
In Greek, οσφυος is a masculine noun of the second declension. Its nominative singular form is οσφύς (osphys), and its genitive singular form is οσφύος (osphyos). The word is declined like the noun ἀνήρ (anēr), which means "man".

Description:
Οσφυος refers to the lower back or the lumbar region of the spine. It is the area between the ribcage and the pelvis, and it is an important part of the body that supports the weight of the upper body and allows for movement and flexibility. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo was said to have been struck in the οσφυος by the arrow of Eros, causing him great pain. The word οσφυος is still used in modern Greek to refer to the lower back.
