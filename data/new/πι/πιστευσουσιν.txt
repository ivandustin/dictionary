Word: πιστευσουσιν

Etymology: πιστευσουσιν is a Greek word that comes from the verb πιστεύω (pisteuō), which means "to believe" or "to have faith". The suffix -σουσιν (-sousin) indicates the third person plural future tense, so πιστευσουσιν means "they will believe" or "they will have faith".

Grammar: πιστευσουσιν is a verb in the third person plural future tense. In Greek, verbs change their endings to indicate tense, person, and number. The root of the verb is πιστεύω (pisteuō), which means "to believe". The suffix -σουσιν (-sousin) indicates the future tense and the third person plural.

Description: πιστευσουσιν is a word that expresses the idea of future belief or future faith. It is often used in religious contexts, such as in the Bible, to describe the belief or faith of a group of people. For example, in John 3:16, it says "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." The word "believes" in this verse is πιστευων (pisteuōn), which is the present participle form of πιστεύω (pisteuō). If we were to use the future tense instead, we could say "they will believe" or "they will have faith", which would be πιστευσουσιν.
