Word: πιοτητος

Etymology: The word πιοτητος (piotitos) is derived from the Greek word ποιότητα (poiotita), which means "quality" or "characteristic". It is formed from the root word ποιός (poios), meaning "what kind of", and the suffix -τητα (-tita), which is used to form abstract nouns.

Grammar: πιοτητος is a feminine noun in the singular form. In Greek, nouns have gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and number (singular or plural). The word is declined according to the second declension, which means that its stem ends in -ος (-os) and its nominative singular form ends in -η (-i).

Description: πιοτητος refers to the quality or characteristic of something. It can be used to describe the nature or essence of a person, thing, or concept. For example, one might say "η πιοτητος της αλήθειας" (i piotitos tis alithias) to mean "the quality of truth". The word is often used in philosophical and academic contexts to discuss the essential qualities of things.
