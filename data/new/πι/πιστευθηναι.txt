The word πιστευθηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word πιστεύω (pisteuō), which means "to believe" or "to have faith." The suffix -θηναι (-thenai) is a passive form that indicates that the action of believing is being done to the subject of the verb.

The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.
