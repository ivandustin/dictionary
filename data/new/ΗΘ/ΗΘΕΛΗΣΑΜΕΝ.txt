The word "ηθελησαμεν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, first person plural form. It comes from the root verb "θέλω" (thélo), which means "to want" or "to wish". The prefix "ε-" (e-) is added to indicate the past tense, and the suffix "-σαμεν" (-samen) indicates the first person plural form. Therefore, "ηθελησαμεν" translates to "we wanted" or "we wished" in English.
