Etymology: The word "εκρυψαν" comes from the Greek verb "κρύπτω" (krypto), which means "to hide" or "to conceal". The prefix "εκ-" (ek-) in Greek denotes "out" or "away", so "εκρυψαν" can be translated as "they hid" or "they concealed".

Grammar: "Εκρυψαν" is the third person plural form of the aorist tense in Greek. The aorist tense is used to describe past actions that are viewed as a whole, without specifying their duration or repetition. In this case, "εκρυψαν" indicates that a group of people hid or concealed something in the past.
