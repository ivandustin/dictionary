The word "εκδεχομενος" (ekdechomenos) is a Greek adjective that comes from the verb "εκδέχομαι" (ekdechomai), which means "to wait for" or "to expect." 

In terms of etymology, the word is derived from the combination of the prefix "εκ-" (ek-), meaning "out" or "from," and the verb "δέχομαι" (dechomai), meaning "to receive" or "to accept." Therefore, "εκδεχομενος" can be understood as "the one who is receiving or accepting something from outside" or "the one who is waiting for something to come."

In grammar, "εκδεχομενος" is a masculine singular form of the adjective, which agrees with a noun of the same gender and number. It can also be declined to match other genders and numbers, such as "εκδεχόμενη" (feminine singular), "εκδεχόμενο" (neuter singular), and "εκδεχόμενοι" (masculine plural).

In terms of description, "εκδεχομενος" describes someone who is waiting for or expecting something. It can be used to describe a person's attitude or state of mind when they are eagerly anticipating an event, an outcome, or the arrival of someone or something.
