μωυσεα (mōusea) is a Greek word that refers to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts and sciences in Greek mythology. The word comes from the Greek verb μῶνος (mōnos), meaning "alone" or "solitary," which is related to the word μόνος (monos) meaning "single" or "alone." The Muses were believed to inspire and guide artists, musicians, poets, and scholars, and were often depicted as young women with musical instruments and other symbols of their respective domains. In Greek grammar, μωυσεα is a feminine noun in the nominative plural form.
