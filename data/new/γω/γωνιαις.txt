The word "γωνιαις" (goniais) is a feminine noun in Greek, which means "corners" or "angles". It is derived from the Greek word "γωνία" (gonia), which means "angle" or "corner". In terms of grammar, it is in the dative case, indicating that it is the indirect object of a verb or a preposition. 

In ancient Greek, "γωνιαις" was often used to refer to the corners of a building or a room. It was also used in geometry to refer to the angles of a shape. In modern Greek, it is still used in the same way, but it can also refer to a difficult or challenging situation, as in "έχω μπλέξει στις γωνιές" (I am stuck in a difficult situation).
