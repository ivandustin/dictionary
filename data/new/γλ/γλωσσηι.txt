I'm sorry, but the word "γλωσσηι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "γλώσσα" (glóssa), which means "tongue" or "language" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "γλώσσα" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *gʷelH- ("to swallow"), which also gave rise to the English words "gulp" and "gullet". 

Grammar: "Γλώσσα" is a feminine noun in Greek, and its plural form is "γλώσσες" (glósses). 

Description: "Γλώσσα" can refer to the physical organ of the tongue, as well as to a language or a dialect. It is a common word in Greek and is used in many idiomatic expressions.
