The word "γλωσσαις" (glōssais) is a Greek noun in the dative plural form, which means "tongues" or "languages". It is derived from the root word "γλῶσσα" (glōssa), which also means "tongue" or "language". In Greek mythology, the god Hermes was said to have invented language and taught it to humans. The word "glossary" also comes from the same root word, as it refers to a list of words and their definitions, often used to aid in language learning. In the New Testament, the word "γλωσσαις" is used to describe the gift of speaking in tongues, which is believed to be a supernatural ability to speak in a language that the speaker has not learned.
