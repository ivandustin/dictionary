Word: κηπουρος

Etymology: The word κηπουρος (kēpouros) comes from the Greek words κῆπος (kēpos) meaning "garden" and οὐρά (oura) meaning "tail". Therefore, κηπουρος originally meant "one who has a tail in the garden", referring to a scarecrow or a person who worked in the garden.

Grammar: κηπουρος is a masculine noun in Greek. It is declined in the singular and plural, and its nominative and accusative forms are the same. For example, "the gardener" can be translated as "ο κηπουρός" (o kēpouros) in the singular and "οι κηπουροί" (oi kēpouroi) in the plural.

Description: κηπουρος refers to a gardener or a person who works in a garden. This can include tasks such as planting, watering, weeding, and harvesting. In modern Greek, the word κηπουρος can also refer to a landscaper or a person who designs and maintains outdoor spaces.
