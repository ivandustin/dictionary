Word: κηρυξας

Etymology:
The word κηρυξας (keruxas) is a Greek verb that comes from the noun κηρυξ (kerux), which means "herald" or "messenger". The verb κηρυσσω (kerusso) means "to proclaim" or "to announce", and κηρυξας is the aorist tense form of this verb, meaning "he proclaimed" or "he announced".

Grammar:
κηρυξας is a second-person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb κηρυσσω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, rather than a continuous or ongoing action. The active voice indicates that the subject (in this case, "you") is performing the action of proclaiming or announcing.

Description:
κηρυξας can be translated as "you proclaimed" or "you announced". The word is often used in the context of a public announcement or proclamation, such as a herald announcing news or a message to a crowd. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe the preaching of the gospel message by Jesus and his disciples.
