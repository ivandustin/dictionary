Etymology: The word "βεβλημένος" comes from the Greek verb "βάλλω" (ballō), which means "to throw" or "to cast". The prefix "βε-" indicates a perfective aspect, indicating completion or a state resulting from an action. The suffix "-μένος" is a participle ending, indicating a passive voice and a present tense. Therefore, "βεβλημένος" can be translated as "having been thrown" or "having been cast".

Grammar: "βεβλημένος" is a masculine singular participle in the nominative case. In Greek grammar, participles are verbal adjectives that can modify nouns or function as independent verbs. The masculine gender indicates that the participle refers to a male subject, while the singular number indicates that it refers to a single subject. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence or a predicate nominative.

Description: "βεβλημένος" describes something or someone that has been thrown or cast. It implies a completed action in the past, with the subject being the receiver of the action. The word can be used in various contexts, such as describing an object that has been thrown, a person who has been cast out, or a situation that has been forcefully imposed.
