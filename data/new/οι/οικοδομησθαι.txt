Word: οικοδομησθαι

Etymology:
The word οικοδομησθαι comes from the Greek root words οικος (oikos) meaning "house" and δομη (dome) meaning "to build". The suffix -σθαι (-sthai) indicates a passive voice, meaning "to be built".

Grammar:
Οικοδομησθαι is a verb in the passive voice, aorist tense, and infinitive mood. It is derived from the verb οικοδομεω (oikodomeo) which means "to build" or "to construct". The passive voice indicates that the action of building is being done to the subject, rather than the subject doing the building.

Description:
Οικοδομησθαι refers to the act of being built or constructed. It can be used to describe the process of building a house, a structure, or any other physical object. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the process of building or developing something abstract, such as a relationship or a skill.
