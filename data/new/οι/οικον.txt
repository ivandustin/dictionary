The word "οικον" (oikon) is a Greek noun that means "house" or "home". It is derived from the Greek word "οικία" (oikia), which also means "house". In terms of grammar, "οικον" is in the accusative case, which is used to indicate the direct object of a verb. 

In ancient Greek, "οικον" was often used in the context of the household or family, and could refer to the physical structure of a house as well as the people who lived in it. It was also used in a broader sense to refer to the management of a household or estate, including the financial and administrative aspects.

In modern Greek, "οικον" is still used to mean "house" or "home", but it can also be used in compound words to refer to various aspects of the economy, such as "οικονομία" (oikonomia), which means "economy" or "management of resources".
