Word: οικοδομείται

Etymology: Οικοδομείται is a Greek word that comes from the combination of two words: οίκος (oikos) meaning "house" and δομέω (domeo) meaning "to build". Therefore, οικοδομείται means "it is being built" or "it is under construction".

Grammar: Οικοδομείται is a verb in the present tense, passive voice, and third person singular form. It is derived from the verb οικοδομώ (oikodomo) which means "to build" or "to construct". The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action, rather than performing it.

Description: Οικοδομείται is a versatile verb that can be used in various contexts. It is commonly used to describe the process of building or constructing something, such as a house, a bridge, or a road. It can also be used metaphorically to describe the process of developing or improving something, such as a relationship, a skill, or a business. In both cases, οικοδομείται implies a gradual and ongoing process of growth and development.
