Word: οικειοι

Etymology:
The word οικειοι (oikeioi) comes from the Greek root word οἶκος (oikos), which means "house" or "home." The suffix -ειος (-eios) is used to form adjectives that indicate belonging or relationship to the root word. Therefore, οικειοι (oikeioi) means "belonging to the same household" or "related by blood."

Grammar:
Οικειοι (oikeioi) is a plural adjective in the masculine gender. It is used to describe a group of people who are related by blood or who belong to the same household. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is feminine or neuter, the adjective would change accordingly.

Description:
Οικειοι (oikeioi) is a word that describes a close relationship between people who share a common ancestry or live in the same household. It can refer to family members, relatives, or even close friends who are considered to be like family. The word conveys a sense of familiarity, intimacy, and trust that is often associated with close-knit communities. In modern Greek, the word is still commonly used to describe family members or close friends.
