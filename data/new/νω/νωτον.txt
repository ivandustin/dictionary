Description:
"Νωτον" is a Greek word that refers to the back or spine of a person or animal. It is an important part of the body that supports the head and allows for movement and flexibility. The spine is made up of a series of bones called vertebrae, which are connected by ligaments and muscles. The spinal cord runs through the center of the spine and is responsible for transmitting messages between the brain and the rest of the body. In Greek mythology, the god Atlas was said to carry the weight of the world on his back, symbolizing the importance of the spine in supporting the body.
