The word "ηκουσαμεν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, first person plural form. It comes from the root verb "ακούω" (akouo), which means "to hear" in English. In Greek grammar, verbs are conjugated based on tense, person, and number. The past tense indicates that the action of hearing occurred in the past. The first person plural form indicates that the subject of the verb is "we." So, "ηκουσαμεν" translates to "we heard" in English.
