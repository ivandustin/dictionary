The word "ηκαιρείσθε" is a Greek verb in the present tense, passive voice, second person plural form. It is derived from the verb "καιρεύω" (kaireúo), which means "to take advantage of an opportunity" or "to make good use of a favorable moment." The prefix "η-" indicates the passive voice, and the suffix "-σθε" indicates the second person plural form. Therefore, "ηκαιρείσθε" can be translated as "you are being taken advantage of" or "you are being made good use of in a favorable moment."
