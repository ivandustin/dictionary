Etymology: The word "εμαυτού" (emautoú) comes from the Greek language. It is a combination of the pronoun "εγώ" (ego), meaning "I," and the reflexive pronoun "μου" (mou), meaning "myself." 

Grammar: "Εμαυτού" is a reflexive pronoun in the genitive case. It is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence and indicate that the action is performed by the subject on itself. In English, it can be translated as "myself."

Description: "Εμαυτού" is used when the subject of the sentence is also the object of the action. It emphasizes self-reliance or self-action. For example, "Κάνω τη δουλειά μου εμαυτού" (Káno ti douleía mou emautoú) means "I do my work myself" or "I do the work on my own."
