Etymology: The word "παραστησώμεν" comes from the Greek verb "παραστήσω" (parastíso), which means "to present" or "to represent." It is derived from the combination of the prefix "παρά" (para), meaning "beside" or "alongside," and the verb "ἵστημι" (hístēmi), meaning "to stand."

Grammar: "παραστησώμεν" is the first person plural, aorist subjunctive active form of the verb "παραστήσω" (parastíso). In Greek grammar, the subjunctive mood is used to express possibility, doubt, or uncertainty. The aorist tense refers to an action that occurred in the past, without specifying its duration or completion.
