Etymology: The word "παρωικησεν" (parōikēsen) comes from the Greek verb "παροικέω" (paroikeō), which means "to dwell near" or "to reside as a stranger." It is derived from the combination of the preposition "παρά" (para), meaning "beside" or "near," and the verb "οἰκέω" (oikeō), meaning "to dwell" or "to inhabit."

Grammar: "παρωικησεν" is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb "παροικέω" (paroikeō). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a past action that is viewed as a whole, without specifying its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.

Description: "παρωικησεν" describes an action that was performed in the past by a third person singular subject. The verb "παροικέω" (paroikeō) itself means "to dwell near" or "to reside as a stranger." Therefore, "παρωικησεν" can be translated as "he/she/it dwelled near" or "he/she/it resided as a stranger."
