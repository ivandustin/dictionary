Word: αφορισθητε

Etymology:
The word αφορισθητε comes from the Greek verb αφορίζω (aphorizo), which means "to separate" or "to set apart". The word is derived from the prefix από (apo), meaning "away from", and the verb χωρίζω (chorizo), meaning "to separate".

Grammar:
αφορισθητε is a second person plural passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the passive voice suffix -θη- (the same suffix used in the aorist passive tense) to the stem αφορισ-, which is the aorist tense stem of the verb αφορίζω. The ending -τε (-te) indicates that the verb is in the imperative mood and that it is addressed to a group of people.

Description:
The word αφορισθητε is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of 2 Corinthians 6:17. The verse reads: "Therefore, come out from their midst and be separate, says the Lord. And do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you." The word αφορισθητε is translated as "be separate" in this context, and it is used to urge the Corinthians to separate themselves from the sinful practices of the world and to live a holy life.
