Etymology:
The word αφησουσιν is a Greek verb in the future tense, third person plural form of the verb αφίημι (aphiēmi), which means "to let go", "to leave", or "to forgive". The root of the word is αφίη (aphiē), which means "release" or "forgiveness".

Grammar:
αφησουσιν is a future tense verb in the third person plural form. In Greek, verbs change their endings to indicate the tense, mood, and person of the action. The future tense indicates that the action will happen in the future. The third person plural form indicates that the subject of the verb is a group of people or things.

Description:
The word αφησουσιν is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 9, verse 5) and the Gospel of Mark (chapter 2, verse 7). In both instances, Jesus uses the word to forgive sins. The word conveys the idea of releasing or letting go of something, in this case, the sins of the person being forgiven. The use of the future tense indicates that the forgiveness will happen in the future, but it is certain to happen.
