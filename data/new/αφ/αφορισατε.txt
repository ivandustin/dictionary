Word: αφορισατε

Etymology: The word αφορισατε comes from the Greek verb αφορίζω (aphorízo), which means "to separate" or "to set apart". It is derived from the prefix από (apó), meaning "from", and the verb χωρίζω (chorízo), meaning "to divide" or "to separate".

Grammar: αφορισατε is the second person plural aorist imperative form of the verb αφορίζω (aphorízo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, and the imperative mood is used to give commands or orders. Therefore, αφορισατε can be translated as "you all separate" or "you all set apart".
