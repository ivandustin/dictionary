Description:
γυμνότης is a term used to describe the state of being naked or the act of being without clothing. In ancient Greece, nudity was a common practice in sports, art, and religious ceremonies.

Today, the word is still used in modern Greek to refer to nudity, but it can also be used metaphorically to describe a state of vulnerability or exposure.
