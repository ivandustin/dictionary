I'm sorry, but the word "βρεχηι" does not exist in the English language or any other language that uses the Latin alphabet. It appears to be a combination of Greek letters, but without context or further information, it is impossible to provide a definition or analysis of its etymology and grammar. Please provide more information or a different word for me to define.
