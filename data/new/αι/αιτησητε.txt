Sorry, I cannot define the word "αιτησητε" as it is not a valid Greek word. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "αίτησητε" which is a combination of the verb "αίτομαι" (ask, request) and the imperative mood of the verb "είμαι" (be). The word "αίτησητε" means "request to be" or "ask to become". 

Etymology: The word "αίτησητε" is a compound word formed from the verb "αίτομαι" and the imperative mood of the verb "είμαι". 

Grammar: "αίτησητε" is the second person plural imperative mood of the verb "αίτομαι". 

Description: "αίτησητε" is a command or request for a group of people to ask or request to become something.
