The middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action upon themselves.

Description:
The word αιτησεσθε is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in Matthew 7:7-8, where Jesus says "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened." Therefore, αιτησεσθε can be interpreted as a call to action, encouraging individuals to ask for what they need or desire.
