I'm sorry, but the word "αισχυνηι" is not a valid Greek word. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "αισχύνη" (aishyni), which means "shame" or "disgrace". 

Etymology: The word comes from the ancient Greek verb "αισχύνομαι" (aishynomai), which means "to feel shame". 

Grammar: "Αισχύνη" is a feminine noun in Greek and is declined like most other feminine nouns. 

Description: "Αισχύνη" refers to the feeling of shame or disgrace that one experiences when they have done something wrong or embarrassing. It can also refer to the state of being shameful or disgraceful. The word is often used in a moral or ethical context.
