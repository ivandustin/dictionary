Etymology:
The word αιτων (aiton) comes from the Greek verb αιτεω (aiteo), which means "to ask" or "to request". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₂eid-.

Grammar:
In Greek, αιτων is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It is also declined in the genitive case as αιτονος (aitonos).

Description:
αιτων is a rare word in Greek that means "beggar" or "supplicant". It is often used in literature to describe a person who is asking for something, usually in a humble or desperate manner. In ancient Greece, beggars were often seen as outcasts and were not well-respected in society. However, in some cases, they were also seen as holy or blessed, as they were believed to have a special connection to the gods.
