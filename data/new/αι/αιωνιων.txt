Word: αιωνιων

Etymology: αιωνιων comes from the Greek word αιώνιος (aiónios), which means eternal or everlasting. The suffix -ων (-on) is added to the end of the word to make it an adjective in the masculine plural form.

Grammar: αιωνιων is an adjective in the masculine plural form. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if αιωνιων is used to describe a feminine or neuter noun, it would need to be changed to αιωνια or αιωνιον, respectively.

Description: αιωνιων is used to describe something that is eternal or everlasting. It can be used to describe a person, place, or thing that is believed to exist forever. In religious contexts, it is often used to describe God or the afterlife. It can also be used in a more general sense to describe something that is timeless or enduring.
