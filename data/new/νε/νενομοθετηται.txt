Word: νενομοθετηται

Etymology:
The word νενομοθετηται is a Greek word that comes from the combination of two words: νόμος (nomos) meaning "law" and τίθημι (tithemi) meaning "to set, to establish". The prefix νενο- (neno-) indicates that the action of setting or establishing the law has already been completed.

Grammar:
νενομοθετηται is a third-person singular verb in the perfect tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. The perfect tense indicates that the action of setting or establishing the law has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (which is not explicitly stated) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description:
The word νενομοθετηται can be translated to English as "has been established by law" or "has been legislated". It implies that something has been officially set or established by a legal authority, and that it is now binding and enforceable. The word can be used in a variety of contexts, such as to describe a new law that has been passed, a regulation that has been put in place, or a policy that has been implemented.
