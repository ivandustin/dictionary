The word "νεκρων" (nekron) is a Greek word that means "of the dead" or "belonging to the dead". It is derived from the Greek word "νεκρός" (nekros), which means "dead" or "lifeless". 

In terms of grammar, "νεκρων" is the genitive plural form of "νεκρός". The genitive case is used to show possession or relationship, and the plural form indicates that the word refers to more than one dead person or thing.

In Greek mythology, the god of the underworld, Hades, was often referred to as "νεκρών βασιλεύς" (nekron basileus), which means "king of the dead". The word "νεκρων" is also commonly used in the New Testament of the Bible to refer to the dead or the deceased.
