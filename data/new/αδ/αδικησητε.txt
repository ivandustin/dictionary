I'm sorry, but the word "αδικησητε" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the verb "αδικήσετε" (adikísete), which means "you will unjustly treat" or "you will wrong." 

Etymology: The word "αδικήσετε" comes from the root word "άδικος" (ádikos), which means "unjust" or "unfair." The suffix "-ήσετε" (-ísete) is a conjugation of the verb "κάνω" (káno), which means "to do" or "to make."

Grammar: "αδικήσετε" is the second person plural future tense of the verb "αδικώ" (adikó), which means "to treat unjustly" or "to wrong." 

Description: The word "αδικήσετε" is a formal and polite way of addressing a group of people and warning them not to act unjustly or unfairly towards someone. It can be used in various contexts, such as in legal or moral discussions, or in personal relationships.
