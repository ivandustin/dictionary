Word: αδιακριτος

Etymology:
The word αδιακριτος comes from the Greek prefix α- (meaning "not") and the word διακριτος (meaning "distinguished" or "separate"). Therefore, αδιακριτος means "undistinguished" or "indiscriminate".

Grammar:
αδιακριτος is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, αδιακριτος can modify a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, such as άνθρωπος (man), to form the phrase αδιακριτος άνθρωπος (undistinguished man).
