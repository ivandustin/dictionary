Description:
αδμειν is a term used in agriculture to describe the act of plowing or tilling the soil in preparation for planting crops. It involves breaking up the soil and turning it over to create a loose, aerated surface that is ideal for planting. This process helps to improve soil structure, increase water retention, and promote the growth of healthy plants. In ancient Greece, plowing was an important part of agriculture and was often done using a team of oxen pulling a plow. Today, modern farming equipment has made the process much easier and more efficient.
