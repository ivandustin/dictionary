The word "αδικηθεντος" is a Greek adjective that means "unjustly treated" or "wronged". It is derived from the verb "αδικέω" (adikéo), which means "to treat unjustly" or "to do wrong". In terms of grammar, "αδικηθεντος" is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action rather than performing it. It is also in the masculine singular nominative case, meaning it is used to describe a singular male subject who has been wronged.
