Word: πυκνοτερον

Etymology: πυκνός (pyknós) means "dense" or "thick" in Greek, and the suffix -τερον (-teron) is a comparative suffix, meaning "more" or "greater". Therefore, πυκνοτερον (pyknoteron) means "more dense" or "denser".

Grammar: πυκνοτερον is an adjective in the comparative form, used to compare the density of two things. It is declined like other third-declension adjectives in Greek.

Description: πυκνοτερον is a word used to describe something that is denser or more tightly packed than something else. It can be used to describe physical objects, such as a dense forest or a tightly packed crowd, or it can be used in a more abstract sense, such as a dense argument or a tightly woven plot.
