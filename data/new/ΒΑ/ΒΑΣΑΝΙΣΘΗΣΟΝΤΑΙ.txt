It is derived from the noun "βάσανος" (basanos), meaning "touchstone" or "test". In ancient times, a touchstone was used to test the purity of gold or silver by rubbing it against the stone. The verb "βασανίζω" was later used metaphorically to describe the act of subjecting someone to intense physical or mental suffering.
