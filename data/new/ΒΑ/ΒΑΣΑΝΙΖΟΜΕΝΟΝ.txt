Etymology: The word "βασανιζομένον" comes from the Greek verb "βασανίζω" (basanizo), which means "to torment" or "to torture." The suffix "-μένον" (-meno) is a participle ending that indicates the passive voice, so "βασανιζόμενον" (basanizomenon) can be translated as "being tormented" or "being tortured."

Grammar: "Βασανιζόμενον" is a present passive participle in the neuter gender, singular number, and accusative case. In Greek grammar, participles are verbal adjectives that can modify nouns or function as nouns themselves. The present tense indicates that the action is happening at the same time as the main verb, and the passive voice indicates that the subject is receiving the action.

Description: "Βασανιζόμενον" describes something or someone that is currently being tormented or tortured. It can be used as an adjective to modify a noun, or as a noun itself to refer to the person or thing undergoing torment.
