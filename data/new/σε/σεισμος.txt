Word: σεισμός

Etymology: The word σεισμός (seismos) comes from the Greek verb σείω (seio), which means "to shake" or "to tremble". It is related to other words in Greek that have to do with shaking or movement, such as σειρά (seira) which means "row" or "line", and σεισμικός (seismikos) which means "seismic" or "related to earthquakes".

Grammar: σεισμός is a masculine noun in Greek, and its plural form is σεισμοί (seismoi). It is a second-declension noun, which means that its stem changes in the genitive case. The genitive singular form is σεισμού (seismou).

Description: σεισμός refers to an earthquake, which is a sudden and violent shaking of the ground caused by the movement of tectonic plates. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, and can also trigger other natural disasters such as tsunamis. Greece is a country that is particularly prone to earthquakes, due to its location on the boundary between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates.
