It is a passive voice form, indicating that the subject of the sentence has received the action of the verb. In this case, the subject is not specified, so it could refer to any group of people who have been saved or rescued.

The word implies that some kind of danger or threat was present, and that the subject has been delivered from it. The context in which the word is used would determine the specific nature of the danger or threat, as well as the identity of the subject who has been saved.
