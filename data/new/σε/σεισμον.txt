Sorry, I cannot define the word "σεισμον" as it is not a valid word in English. It appears to be a Greek word, which means "earthquake" in English. 

Etymology: The word "σεισμον" is derived from the Greek word "σείσμα" (seisma), which means "a shaking or a quake". 

Grammar: "σεισμον" is a noun in the singular form. In Greek, nouns have gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and declension (changes in form depending on their grammatical function in a sentence). 

Description: "σεισμον" refers to a sudden and violent shaking of the ground caused by the movement of tectonic plates. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and human life. They are often accompanied by aftershocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur after the main earthquake.
