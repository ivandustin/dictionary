Description: ναζωραιων is a term used in the New Testament to refer to the followers of Jesus Christ. It is often translated as "Nazarenes" or "Nazareans." The term is used in several places in the New Testament, including Acts 24:5, where the apostle Paul is accused of being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. The term is also used in Matthew 2:23, where it is said that Jesus was called a Nazarene because he grew up in Nazareth. The term has been the subject of much debate among scholars, with some suggesting that it refers to a specific sect or group of followers of Jesus, while others argue that it simply refers to anyone who came from Nazareth.
