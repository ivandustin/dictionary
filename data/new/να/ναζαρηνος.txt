The word "ναζαρηνος" (nazarenos) is a Greek term that is commonly translated as "Nazarene" in English. It is derived from the Hebrew word "netzer" which means "branch" or "shoot". In the New Testament, the term is used to refer to Jesus Christ, who was born and raised in the town of Nazareth. 

In terms of grammar, "ναζαρηνος" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as genitive ("ναζαρηνου"), dative ("ναζαρηνω"), and accusative ("ναζαρηνον").

In addition to its use in the New Testament, "ναζαρηνος" has also been used historically to refer to Christians in general, particularly in the Middle East. Today, it is still used in some Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions to refer to Jesus Christ.
