Word: ναζωραιος

Etymology:
The word ναζωραιος (nazōraios) is derived from the Hebrew word נָזִיר (nazir), which means "consecrated" or "separated". In the Old Testament, a Nazirite was a person who took a vow to separate themselves to God, abstaining from wine, cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with the dead.

Grammar:
ναζωραιος is a Greek adjective that means "of or from Nazareth". It is used to describe Jesus Christ in the New Testament, as he is often referred to as Jesus of Nazareth (Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος). The word is declined in the masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case.

Description:
ναζωραιος is a term that is closely associated with Jesus Christ and his hometown of Nazareth. It is used to identify him as a resident of Nazareth and to distinguish him from other individuals with the same name. The word has become a symbol of Jesus' humble origins and his identification with the common people of his time.
