Description: ζιζανία is a type of weed that grows in fields and gardens. It is often considered a nuisance because it competes with crops for nutrients and can reduce their yield. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, black seeds. In ancient times, it was sometimes mixed with wheat or barley, which could cause illness if consumed. Today, farmers use herbicides to control the growth of ζιζανία and other weeds.
