The word "αποκρυφοι" (apokryfoi) is a Greek adjective that means "hidden" or "secret". It is derived from the Greek word "απόκρυφος" (apokryphos), which means "obscure" or "hidden away". In grammar, it is a masculine plural form of the adjective, used to describe a group of people or things that are hidden or secret. 

In ancient times, the term "απόκρυφος" was often used to describe religious texts or teachings that were not considered part of the mainstream or accepted canon. These texts were often considered to be secret or hidden knowledge, and were only shared with a select few. Today, the term is still used to describe anything that is hidden or secret, whether it be knowledge, information, or even a group of people.
