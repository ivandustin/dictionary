Description: απολελυσαι is a powerful and meaningful word in Greek, as it conveys the idea of being released or set free from something that was holding you back. It can refer to physical release from captivity or imprisonment, but it can also have a more metaphorical meaning, such as being released from guilt, shame, or fear.
