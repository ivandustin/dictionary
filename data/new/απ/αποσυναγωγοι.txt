Etymology: The word αποσυναγωγοι comes from the Greek prefix απο- (apo-), meaning "away from," and the word συναγωγή (synagoge), meaning "assembly" or "congregation." Therefore, αποσυναγωγοι literally means "those who are away from the congregation."

Grammar: αποσυναγωγοι is a plural noun in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -οι (-oi) to the stem αποσυναγωγ- (aposynagog-).

Description: αποσυναγωγοι is a term used in the New Testament to refer to those who were expelled from the Jewish synagogues because of their belief in Jesus as the Messiah.
