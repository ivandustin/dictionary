Word: απωλοντο

Etymology: 
The word απωλοντο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb απόλλυμι (apollymi), which means "to destroy" or "to perish". The verb is derived from the noun Απόλλων (Apollon), the Greek god of music, poetry, prophecy, and healing. In Greek mythology, Apollon was also associated with destruction and plague.

Grammar:
απωλοντο is the third person plural, aorist middle-passive indicative form of the verb απόλλυμι. The aorist tense in Greek refers to a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, the verb form indicates that the subject (which is not specified) was destroyed or perished.

Description:
απωλοντο is a Greek verb form that describes an action of destruction or perishing. Without context, it is impossible to determine the subject of the verb, but the form itself indicates that the action took place in the past and that the subject was both the doer and the receiver of the action.
