Word: απεκρίθης

Etymology:
The word απεκρίθης (apekrithēs) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρίνω (krinō), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix απο- (apo-) means "away from" or "off", so απεκρίθης can be translated as "you answered off" or "you replied away from".

Grammar:
απεκρίθης is the second person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb αποκρίνομαι (apokrinomai), which means "to answer" or "to reply". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the indicative mood indicates a statement of fact.

Description:
απεκρίθης is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, to describe the responses of various characters to questions or statements. For example, in Matthew 22:37, Jesus is asked what the greatest commandment is, and he responds with the famous statement, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." The Greek text reads, "Αγαπήσεις κύριον τον θεόν σου εξ όλης της καρδίας σου και εξ όλης της ψυχής σου και εξ όλης της διανοίας σου. Αυτή εστιν η μεγάλη και πρώτη εντολή." (Agapēseis kyrion ton theon sou ex holēs tēs kardias sou kai ex holēs tēs psychēs sou kai ex holēs tēs dianoias sou. Autē estin hē megale kai prōtē entolē.) The word απεκρίθης is not used in this passage, but it is used in many other passages throughout the New Testament.
