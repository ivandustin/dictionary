Word: απεδοντο

Etymology: απεδοντο is a verb form in the ancient Greek language, specifically in the aorist tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. It comes from the verb ἀποδίδωμι (apodidomi), which means "to give back, to return, to restore." 

Grammar: απεδοντο is a third-person plural form of the verb ἀποδίδωμι (apodidomi). In the aorist tense, this form indicates that the action of giving back or returning has been completed in the past. In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action of the verb, rather than performing it. In the indicative mood, the verb is used to make a statement or ask a question.

Description: απεδοντο can be translated as "they were given back" or "they were returned" in English. The context in which it is used would determine the specific meaning.
