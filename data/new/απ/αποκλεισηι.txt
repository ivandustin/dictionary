I'm sorry, but the word "αποκλεισηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "αποκλειση" (apokleisi), which means "exclusion" or "blockade". 

Etymology: The word "αποκλειση" comes from the prefix "απο-" (apo-), meaning "away from" or "off", and the verb "κλείνω" (kleino), meaning "to close". 

Grammar: "Αποκλειση" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "Αποκλειση" refers to the act of preventing access or entry to a place or situation. It can also refer to the state of being excluded or isolated.
