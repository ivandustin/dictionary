Word: απεστειλα

Etymology:
The word απεστειλα (apestila) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "στέλλω" (stello), which means "to send". The prefix "από" (apo) means "from" or "away", so απεστειλα can be translated as "I sent away" or "I dispatched".

Grammar:
απεστειλα is a first-person singular aorist indicative active verb in Greek. The aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, and the indicative mood indicates a statement of fact. The active voice means that the subject of the sentence (in this case, "I") is performing the action.

Description:
