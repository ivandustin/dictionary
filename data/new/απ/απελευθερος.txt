Word: απελευθερος

Etymology:
The word απελευθερος comes from the Greek language. It is derived from the combination of two words: από (apo) meaning "away from" and ελευθερία (eleftheria) meaning "freedom". Therefore, απελευθερος means "not free" or "unfree".

Grammar:
απελευθερος is an adjective in the masculine gender, singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, απελευθερος can modify a masculine singular noun like άνδρας (man) to form the phrase απελευθερος άνδρας (unfree man).
