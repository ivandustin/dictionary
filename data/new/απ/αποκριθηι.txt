The word "αποκριθηι" (apokrithi) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, which means it refers to a completed action in the past. It is the third person singular form of the verb "αποκρίνομαι" (apokrinomai), which means "to answer" or "to reply". 

The etymology of the word comes from the prefix "από" (apo), which means "from" or "away", and the verb "κρίνω" (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide". Therefore, "αποκρίνομαι" literally means "to judge from" or "to decide from", which evolved to mean "to answer" or "to reply".

In terms of grammar, "αποκριθηι" is in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. It is also in the passive voice, which means that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action rather than performing it. 

Overall, "αποκριθηι" means "he/she/it was answered/replied to" in English.
