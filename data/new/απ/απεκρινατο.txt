Word: απεκρίνατο

Etymology:
The word απεκρίνατο (apekrinato) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word κρίνω (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide". The prefix απο- (apo) means "away from" or "off", so απεκρίνατο can be translated as "he/she/it answered away from" or "he/she/it replied off".

Grammar:
απεκρίνατο is the third person singular, past tense, middle voice form of the verb αποκρίνομαι (apokrinomai), which means "to answer" or "to reply". The middle voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, απεκρίνατο means "he/she/it answered for himself/herself/itself".

Description:
