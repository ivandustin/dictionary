Word: απερχεσθαι

Etymology:
The word απερχεσθαι (aperchesthai) is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix απο- (apo-), meaning "away from," and the verb ερχομαι (erchomai), meaning "to come." Therefore, απερχεσθαι means "to go away" or "to depart."

Grammar:
απερχεσθαι is a present middle/passive infinitive verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -σθαι (-sthai) to the present stem of the verb ερχομαι (erchomai). The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.
