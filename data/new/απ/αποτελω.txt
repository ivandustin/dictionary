Word: αποτελώ

Etymology: αποτελώ comes from the combination of two Greek words: από (apo) meaning "from" or "away from" and τελώ (teló) meaning "to complete" or "to finish". Therefore, αποτελώ means "to complete or finish something from a distance or away from it".

Grammar: αποτελώ is a verb in the present tense, first person singular form. It belongs to the first conjugation of Greek verbs, which means that it follows the regular pattern of verbs that end in -ω. The verb stem is τελ-, and the prefix από (apo) is added to it to form the present tense.

Description: αποτελώ means "to constitute", "to make up", or "to form". It is often used to describe the parts that make up a whole. For example, "Τα συστατικά αποτελούν το κέικ" (The ingredients make up the cake). It can also be used to describe the completion of a task or the achievement of a goal. For example, "Η επιτυχία αποτελεί τον στόχο μου" (Success is my goal).
