Word: απεκριθησαν

Etymology: απεκριθησαν is a Greek word that comes from the verb αποκρίνομαι (apokrinomai), which means "to answer" or "to reply". The word is formed by adding the prefix απο- (apo-), which means "away from" or "off", to the verb κρίνω (krino), which means "to judge" or "to decide".

Grammar: απεκριθησαν is the third person plural aorist indicative active form of the verb αποκρίνομαι (apokrinomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates that the action is a statement of fact, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description: απεκριθησαν means "they answered" or "they replied" in English. The word is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the responses of Jesus' disciples or other characters in the stories. The word can also be used in a more general sense to describe any kind of response or reply to a question or statement.
