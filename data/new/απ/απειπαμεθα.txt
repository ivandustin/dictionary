The word "απειπαμεθα" is a verb in the Greek language. Its etymology can be traced back to the prefix "απο-" which means "away from" or "off", and the verb "ειπον" which means "I said". Therefore, "απειπαμεθα" can be translated as "we said goodbye" or "we departed".

In terms of grammar, "απειπαμεθα" is a first-person plural aorist middle voice verb. The aorist tense indicates that the action happened in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject was both the doer and the receiver of the action.

In terms of description, "απειπαμεθα" is a formal and somewhat archaic way of saying "we said goodbye" or "we departed". It is not commonly used in modern Greek, but it can be found in literature or historical texts.
