Word: απωσαντο

Etymology: απωσαντο is a verb form in the aorist passive voice of the Greek verb απωθέω (apothéō), which means "to push away" or "to repel". The word is derived from the prefix από (apó), meaning "away from", and the verb ωθέω (othéō), meaning "to push".

Grammar: απωσαντο is the third person plural form of the aorist passive tense in Greek. The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is completed, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Description: απωσαντο can be translated as "they were pushed away" or "they were repelled". The word implies that the subject was acted upon by an external force or agent, rather than acting on their own. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as describing a physical force pushing something away, or a person being rejected or excluded from a group.
