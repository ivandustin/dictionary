Word: απεξεδεχετο

Etymology: The word απεξεδεχετο comes from the Greek verb απεξεδέχομαι (apexedéchomai), which is a compound word made up of the prefix απο- (apo-), meaning "away from," and the verb εξεδέχομαι (exedéchomai), meaning "to receive, accept." The prefix απο- in this case indicates a complete or final action, so απεξεδέχομαι means "to accept finally, to receive completely."
