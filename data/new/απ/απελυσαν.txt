Word: απελυσαν

Etymology: απελυσαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word απολυω (apoluo), which means "to release" or "to set free". It is formed by adding the suffix -σαν (-san) to the stem απελυ- (apeluo).

Grammar: απελυσαν is the third person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb απολυω (apoluo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description: απελυσαν means "they released" or "they set free" in English. It is a verb that is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the act of releasing someone from captivity or imprisonment. For example, in Luke 23:16, Pilate says to the crowd, "I will therefore chastise him, and release him." The word "release" in this verse is translated from the Greek word απελυσαν.
