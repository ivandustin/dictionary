I'm sorry, but the word "αποκαταλλαξηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "αποκατάλλαξη" (apokatállaxi), which means "reconciliation" or "restoration of friendly relations". 

Etymology: The word is derived from the prefix "απο-" (apo-), meaning "away from" or "off", and the verb "καταλλάσσω" (katallássō), meaning "to reconcile" or "to make peace". 

Grammar: "αποκατάλλαξη" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: The word refers to the act of restoring friendly relations between two parties who were previously in conflict or disagreement. It can also refer to the process of making amends or resolving a dispute.
