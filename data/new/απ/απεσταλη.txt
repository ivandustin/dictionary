Word: απεσταλη

Etymology:
The word απεσταλη (apostalē) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word αποστέλλω (apostellō), which means "to send away" or "to dispatch." It is derived from the prefix από (apó), meaning "away from," and the verb στέλλω (stellō), meaning "to send."

Grammar:
απεσταλη is the third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb αποστέλλω (apostellō). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:
The word απεσταλη is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the sending or dispatching of messengers or apostles. For example, in John 20:21, Jesus says to his disciples, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." The word απεσταλη is used here to describe the sending of the disciples as messengers or apostles.
