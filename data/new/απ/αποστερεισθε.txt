Word: αποστερεισθε

Etymology: The word αποστερεισθε comes from the Greek verb αποστερέω (aposteréo), which means "to deprive, to rob, to withhold". It is derived from the prefix από (apó), meaning "away from", and the verb στερέω (steréo), meaning "to make firm, to support".

Grammar: αποστερεισθε is a second person plural present passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εισθε (-eiste) to the stem αποστερε-, which is the second person plural present active imperative form of the verb αποστερέω (aposteréo). The passive voice indicates that the action is being done to the subject, rather than the subject doing the action.

Description: αποστερεισθε is a command or instruction in Greek, telling a group of people to be deprived or robbed of something. The context of the sentence would determine what exactly is being withheld or taken away.
