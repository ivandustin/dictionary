Word: απηγγειλαν

Etymology:
The word απηγγειλαν is derived from the Greek verb απαγγέλλω (apangello), which means "to announce" or "to report". The prefix απο- (apo-) means "away from" or "off", and the root word αγγελία (angelia) means "message" or "news". Therefore, απηγγειλαν can be translated as "they reported" or "they announced".

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.
