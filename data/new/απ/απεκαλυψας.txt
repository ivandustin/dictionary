The word "απεκαλυψας" (apekalypsas) is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, which means it refers to a completed action in the past. It is the second person singular form of the verb "αποκαλυπτω" (apokalypto), which means "to reveal" or "to uncover". 

The word is composed of two parts: "απο" (apo), which means "from" or "away", and "καλυπτω" (kalypto), which means "to cover" or "to hide". Therefore, "αποκαλυπτω" literally means "to uncover from hiding" or "to reveal from covering".

In the context of the New Testament, "απεκαλυψας" is used in the book of Revelation (1:1) as the opening phrase, which is often translated as "The revelation of Jesus Christ". This suggests that the word is associated with the idea of divine revelation or disclosure of hidden knowledge.
