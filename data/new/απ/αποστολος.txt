Word: αποστολος

Etymology: The word αποστολος (apostolos) comes from the Greek verb αποστελλω (apostello), which means "to send away" or "to send forth". In the New Testament, the word is used to refer to the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus Christ to spread his teachings.

Grammar: αποστολος is a masculine noun in Greek. It is in the nominative case, which is used for the subject of a sentence. The word can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive case (αποστόλου) for possession or the accusative case (απόστολον) for the direct object of a sentence.

Description: αποστολος is commonly translated as "apostle" in English. In the New Testament, it refers specifically to the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus Christ, but it can also be used more broadly to refer to anyone who is sent on a mission or task. The word is often used in Christian contexts to refer to missionaries or messengers of the faith.
