The word "αποκριθεν" is a Greek verb that means "answered" or "replied". It is the aorist tense of the verb "αποκρίνομαι" (apokrinomai), which is derived from the prefix "από" (apo), meaning "away from", and the verb "κρίνω" (krino), meaning "to judge" or "to decide". Therefore, "αποκριθεν" literally means "judged away from" or "decided away from", but in context it simply means "answered" or "replied". 

In terms of grammar, "αποκριθεν" is a third person singular aorist indicative active verb. The aorist tense in Greek generally refers to a past action that is viewed as a single event, rather than a continuous or ongoing action. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact, rather than a command or a possibility. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, rather than receiving it.
