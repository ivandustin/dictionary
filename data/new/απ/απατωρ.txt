Word: απατωρ

Etymology:
The word απατωρ comes from the Greek language. It is a compound word consisting of the prefix α- (meaning "not") and the word πατηρ (meaning "father"). Therefore, απατωρ means "fatherless" or "without a father".

Grammar:
In Greek, απατωρ is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive case απατωρος (of a fatherless person) or the accusative case απατωρα (a fatherless person).

Description:
απατωρ is a word that describes someone who does not have a father. It can be used to refer to someone who has lost their father, or someone who was born without a father. In ancient Greek society, being fatherless was considered a disadvantage, as fathers played an important role in the upbringing and education of their children. However, in modern times, the term απατωρ is used more broadly to refer to anyone who does not have a father figure in their life.
