Word: αποδεκατουν

Etymology: The word αποδεκατουν comes from the Greek prefix απο- (apo-), meaning "away from," and the word δεκάτων (dekaton), meaning "tenth." Together, αποδεκατουν means "to take away a tenth," which is a reference to the practice of tithing in ancient Greece.

Grammar: αποδεκατουν is a verb in the present tense, third person plural form. It is derived from the verb αποδεκατώνω (apodekatono), which means "to tithe" or "to give a tenth." The verb is formed by adding the present tense ending -ουν (-oun) to the stem αποδεκατων- (apodekatōn-).

Description: αποδεκατουν refers to the act of giving a tenth of one's income or possessions as a religious or charitable offering. In ancient Greece, tithing was a common practice among the wealthy and was often used to support the temples and priests of the gods. Today, tithing is still practiced by some religious groups as a way of supporting their communities and charitable causes.
