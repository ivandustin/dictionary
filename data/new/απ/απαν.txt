The word "απαν" (apan) is a Greek adverb that means "altogether" or "completely". 

Etymology: The word comes from the ancient Greek prefix "ἀ-" (a-), which means "not" or "without", and the noun "πᾶς" (pas), which means "all" or "every". 

Grammar: "Απαν" is an indeclinable adverb, meaning it does not change form based on gender, number, or case. It is always spelled the same way and used in the same form. 

Description: "Απαν" is often used to emphasize the completeness or totality of something. For example, "Απαν το σπίτι ήταν γεμάτο ανθρώπους" (Apan to spiti itan gemato anthropous) means "The whole house was full of people". It can also be used to indicate that something is done completely or thoroughly, as in "Το έκανα απαν σήμερα" (To ekan apan simera), which means "I did it completely today".
