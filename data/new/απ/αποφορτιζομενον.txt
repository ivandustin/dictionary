Word: αποφορτιζομενον

Etymology: 
The word αποφορτιζομενον is a present participle form of the Greek verb αποφορτίζω (apofortízo), which means "to discharge, unload, or relieve." The word is derived from the prefix από (apó), meaning "away from," and the verb φορτίζω (fortízo), meaning "to load or burden."

Grammar:
αποφορτιζομενον is a present participle in the passive voice, which means that the subject is receiving the action of the verb. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it would be in the neuter gender, singular number, and nominative case, since the participle agrees with the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. The verb stem is αποφορτιζ-, and the ending -ομενον (-omenon) indicates the present participle form.

Description:
αποφορτιζομενον can be translated as "being discharged, unloaded, or relieved." It describes an ongoing action or state of being, rather than a completed action. The word can be used in various contexts, such as in the description of a cargo ship being unloaded, a person being relieved of their duties, or a battery being discharged.
