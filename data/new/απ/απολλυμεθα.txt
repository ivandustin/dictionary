Word: απολλυμεθα

Etymology:
The word απολλυμεθα is derived from the Greek verb απόλλυμι (apollymi), which means "to destroy" or "to perish". The suffix -μεθα (-metha) indicates that the verb is in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Grammar:
απολλυμεθα is a first-person plural form of the present tense in the middle voice. It can be translated as "we are being destroyed" or "we are perishing". The verb belongs to the second conjugation in Greek, which means that it has a stem ending in -λλυ- (-llyu-) and a thematic vowel -ε- (-e-) in the present tense.

Description:
απολλυμεθα is a strong and dramatic verb that conveys a sense of imminent danger or destruction. It is often used in contexts related to war, natural disasters, or personal tragedies. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo was associated with both destruction and healing, which reflects the ambivalent nature of this verb.
