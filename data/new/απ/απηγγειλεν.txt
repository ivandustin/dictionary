Word: απηγγειλεν

Etymology:
The word απηγγειλεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word αγγελος (angelos), which means "messenger" or "angel". The prefix απο (apo) means "away from" or "off", so απηγγειλεν can be translated as "to report" or "to announce".

Grammar:
απηγγειλεν is a third-person singular aorist active indicative verb in Greek. It is conjugated from the verb απαγγελλω (apaggello), which means "to report" or "to announce". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.
