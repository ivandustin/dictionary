Word: αποδεκατεύω

Etymology: The word αποδεκατεύω comes from the Greek prefix απο- (apo-), meaning "away from," and the verb δεκατεύω (dekateuo), meaning "to tithe." Therefore, αποδεκατεύω means "to untithe" or "to stop tithing."

Grammar: αποδεκατεύω is a verb in the present tense, active voice, indicative mood, and first person singular form. The verb stem is δεκατευ-, and the prefix απο- indicates a separation or cessation of the action.
