The word "απολεσθαι" (apolesthai) is a Greek verb that means "to be lost" or "to perish". It is derived from the prefix "apo-" which means "away from" and the verb "leipo" which means "to leave". In terms of grammar, "απολεσθαι" is a passive infinitive verb form, meaning that the action is being done to the subject rather than the subject doing the action. 

In ancient Greek literature, "απολεσθαι" is often used to describe the fate of those who have angered the gods or who have acted against the natural order of things. It can also be used in a more general sense to describe something that has been lost or destroyed. 

Overall, "απολεσθαι" is a powerful and evocative word that conveys a sense of finality and inevitability.
