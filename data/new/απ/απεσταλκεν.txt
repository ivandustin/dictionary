Word: απεσταλκεν

Etymology: απεσταλκεν is a Greek word that comes from the verb αποστέλλω (apostellō), which means "to send away" or "to dispatch". It is formed by adding the prefix απο- (apo-), which indicates separation or departure, to the verb στέλλω (stellō), which means "to send".

Grammar: απεσταλκεν is the third person singular perfect active indicative form of the verb αποστέλλω (apostellō). In Greek, the perfect tense is used to indicate a completed action in the past that has ongoing relevance in the present. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement of fact.

Description: απεσταλκεν can be translated as "he/she/it has sent" or "he/she/it sent". It is a verb that describes the act of sending something or someone away. The perfect tense suggests that the action of sending has been completed, but the effects of the action may still be felt in the present. The word can be used in a variety of contexts, such as describing the sending of a message, a package, or a person to a particular destination.
