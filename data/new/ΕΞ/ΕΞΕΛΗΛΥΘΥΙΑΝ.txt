Etymology: The word "εξεληλυθυίαν" (exelēlythuían) comes from the Greek verb "εξέρχομαι" (exérchomai), which means "to go out" or "to come forth." The suffix "-ληλυθυίαν" ("-lēlythuían") is a form of the verb "έρχομαι" (érchomai), which means "to come." Therefore, "εξεληλυθυίαν" can be translated as "to have come out" or "to have emerged."
