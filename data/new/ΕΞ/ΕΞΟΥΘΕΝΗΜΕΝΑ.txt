Etymology: The word "εξουθενημένα" comes from the Greek language. It is derived from the verb "εξουθενώ" (exouthenó), which means "to exhaust" or "to wear out". The suffix "-μένα" (-mena) is added to the verb to form the adjective "εξουθενημένα" (exouthenimena), which means "exhausted" or "worn out".

Grammar: "Εξουθενημένα" is the plural form of the adjective. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if the noun is singular and feminine, the adjective would be "εξουθενημένη" (exouthenimeni). If the noun is singular and neuter, the adjective would be "εξουθενημένο" (exouthenimeno). If the noun is plural and masculine or feminine, the adjective would be "εξουθενημένοι" (exouthenimenoi) or "εξουθενημένες" (exouthenimenes) respectively. If the noun is plural and neuter, the adjective would be "εξουθενημένα" (exouthenimena).

Description: "Εξουθενημένα" is an adjective that describes something or someone that is exhausted or worn out. It can be used to describe physical exhaustion, mental fatigue, or the feeling of being completely drained.
