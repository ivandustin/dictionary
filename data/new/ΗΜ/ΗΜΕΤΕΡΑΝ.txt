Etymology: The word "ημετεραν" (pronounced "im-eh-ter-an") comes from the Greek language. It is a combination of the possessive pronoun "ημετέρα" (meaning "our") and the accusative case ending "-ν" (used for direct objects).

Grammar: "Ημετεραν" is a feminine accusative singular form of the possessive pronoun "ημετέρα" (our). In Greek, pronouns change their form depending on the case, number, and gender of the noun they modify. The accusative case is used to indicate the direct object of a verb.

Description: "Ημετεραν" is used to indicate possession or ownership in the first person plural (we/our). It is used when referring to something that belongs to the speaker and one or more other people. For example, "Ημετεραν τηλέφωνο" (our phone) or "Ημετεραν φίλοι" (our friends).
