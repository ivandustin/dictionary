The word "ημαρτηκαμεν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, first person plural form. It comes from the root word "αμαρτάνω" (amartano), which means "to sin" or "to make a mistake." The suffix "-κα-" indicates the past tense, and the ending "-μεν" indicates the first person plural form. Therefore, "ημαρτηκαμεν" translates to "we sinned" or "we made a mistake."
