The word "φοβεισθε" is a verb in the present tense, second person plural form, in the Greek language. It comes from the root word "φοβέω" which means "to fear" or "to be afraid". The suffix "-εισθε" indicates that the verb is in the middle or passive voice, meaning that the subject is either performing the action on themselves or is being acted upon by an external force.

In English, "φοβεισθε" can be translated as "you are afraid" or "you are being feared". It is often used in the context of warning or caution, as in "φοβεισθε τους κινδύνους" which means "beware of the dangers".
