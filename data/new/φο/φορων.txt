Description:
φορων is a term used in astronomy to refer to a type of binary star system. It is also known as an eclipsing binary, which means that the two stars in the system orbit each other in such a way that they periodically eclipse each other from our point of view on Earth. This causes the brightness of the system to vary over time. The term φορων is also used in other scientific fields to refer to similar types of systems.
