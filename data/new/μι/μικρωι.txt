I'm sorry, but the word "μικρωι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "μικρός" (mikrós), which means "small" or "little". 

Etymology: The word "μικρός" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *smik-, meaning "small". 

Grammar: "Μικρός" is an adjective in the masculine singular form. It can also be declined to match the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. 

Description: "Μικρός" is a common Greek word used to describe something that is small in size or quantity. It can also be used figuratively to describe something that is insignificant or unimportant.
