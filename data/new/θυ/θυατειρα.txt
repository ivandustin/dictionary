θυατειρα (thuateira) is a Greek word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible. It is the name of a city mentioned in the book of Revelation (2:18-29) as one of the seven churches of Asia. The etymology of the word is uncertain, but it is believed to be a compound of two Greek words: θυω (thuo), meaning "to sacrifice," and τειρα (teira), which may be a proper name or a reference to a trade or industry. 

In terms of grammar, θυατειρα is a feminine noun in the nominative case. It is declined like a first-declension noun, with the genitive form being θυατειρας (thuateiras) and the accusative form being θυατειραν (thuateiran).

In the context of the book of Revelation, the city of θυατειρα is described as having a Christian community that is praised for its faith and endurance, but also criticized for tolerating a false prophetess named Jezebel who leads some members of the church astray. The message to the church of θυατειρα is one of warning and encouragement to remain faithful to Christ and resist false teachings.
