The word "χρη" (chre) is a Greek term that has several meanings depending on the context in which it is used. 

Etymology: The word "χρη" comes from the Greek verb "χρῆσθαι" (chrēsthai), which means "to use" or "to make use of." 

Grammar: "Χρη" is a noun in the nominative singular form. It is often used in combination with other words to form compound nouns, such as "χρηστήριο" (chrestērio), which means "a place of use" or "a tool." 

Description: In ancient Greek literature, "χρη" was often used to refer to an oracle or a prophecy. It was believed that the gods would communicate their will through the oracle, and the oracle would then interpret the message for the people. In this context, "χρη" can be translated as "divine utterance" or "oracle." 

In modern Greek, "χρη" is not commonly used as a standalone word, but it can still be found in compound words and phrases. For example, "χρηστικός" (chrestikos) means "useful," and "χρησιμοποιώ" (chresimopoiō) means "to use."
