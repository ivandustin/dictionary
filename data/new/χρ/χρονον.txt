Sorry, I cannot provide a definition for the word "χρονον" as it is not a valid word in the English language. It appears to be a misspelling of the Greek word "χρόνον" which means "time" in English. 

Etymology: The word "χρόνον" comes from the Greek word "χρόνος" (chronos) which means "time". 

Grammar: "χρόνον" is a singular noun in the accusative case in Greek. 

Description: "χρόνον" refers to the concept of time, the indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future.
