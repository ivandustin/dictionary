I'm sorry, but the word "πνοην" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "πνοή" (pnói), which means "breath" or "breathing". 

Etymology: The word "πνοή" comes from the Greek verb "πνέω" (pnéo), which means "to blow" or "to breathe". 

Grammar: "πνοή" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "πνοή" refers to the act of breathing or the air that is breathed in and out of the lungs. It is a vital process for all living organisms that require oxygen to survive. The word can also be used metaphorically to describe the essence or spirit of something.
