ξενιζονται (xenizontai) is a Greek verb in the present tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. It comes from the root word ξένος (xenos), which means "foreigner" or "stranger." The verb ξενίζω (xenizo) means "to make someone feel like a foreigner" or "to treat someone as an outsider." 

Therefore, ξενιζονται means "they are being made to feel like foreigners" or "they are being treated as outsiders." It can be used in various contexts, such as describing how immigrants or refugees are treated in a new country, or how someone is being excluded from a group.
