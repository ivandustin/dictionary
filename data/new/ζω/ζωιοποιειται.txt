Description: ζωιοποιείται is a term used in biology to describe the process of creating an animal from non-living matter. This concept is often associated with the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed in spontaneous generation, the idea that living organisms could arise from non-living matter. However, this theory has been disproven by modern science, and the term ζωιοποιείται is now used more metaphorically to describe the process of creating something new or bringing something to life.
