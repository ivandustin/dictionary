Word: ζωνη

Etymology:
The word ζωνη (zōnē) comes from the Ancient Greek word ζώνη (zṓnē), which means "belt" or "girdle". It is derived from the verb ζώννυμι (zṓnnymi), which means "to gird" or "to fasten with a belt".

Grammar:
ζωνη is a feminine noun in Greek, and its nominative singular form is η ζώνη (i zōnē). In the plural form, it becomes οι ζώνες (oi zōnes). It is declined like a first-declension noun, with the genitive singular form being της ζώνης (tēs zōnēs) and the accusative singular form being την ζώνη (tēn zōnē).

Description:
ζωνη refers to a belt or a girdle that is worn around the waist to hold clothing in place or to support the body. In Ancient Greece, it was a common accessory for both men and women, and it was often made of leather or fabric and decorated with metal buckles or other embellishments. Today, ζωνη is still used in modern Greek to refer to a belt, but it can also be used metaphorically to describe something that encircles or binds.
