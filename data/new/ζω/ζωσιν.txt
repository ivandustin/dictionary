Ζωσιν (zosin) is a Greek word that is the third person plural present active indicative form of the verb ζώννυμι (zonnymi), which means "to gird" or "to fasten with a belt." The word is derived from the noun ζώνη (zone), which means "a belt" or "a girdle." In ancient Greece, men and women wore belts to hold up their clothing, and soldiers wore them to hold their weapons. The verb ζώννυμι is also used metaphorically to mean "to prepare" or "to equip oneself."
