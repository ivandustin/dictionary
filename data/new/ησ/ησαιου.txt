Word: ησαιου

Etymology: ησαιου is a Greek name that comes from the Hebrew name יְשַׁעְיָהוּ (Yeshayahu), which means "Yahweh is salvation". It is a combination of two words: יָשַׁע (yasha), which means "to save", and יָהוּ (Yahu), which is a shortened form of Yahweh, the Hebrew name for God.

Grammar: ησαιου is a proper noun in Greek and is typically used as a name for the prophet Isaiah in the Old Testament. It is declined in the genitive case as ησαίου (Isaiou) when used in phrases such as "the book of Isaiah" (τὸ βιβλίον τοῦ Ἠσαΐου).

Description: ησαιου is a significant name in both Jewish and Christian traditions, as Isaiah is considered one of the major prophets in the Old Testament. His prophecies are known for their poetic language and vivid imagery, and many of them are seen as foreshadowing the coming of Jesus Christ. The name ησαιου is still used today as a given name in Greece and other Greek-speaking countries.
