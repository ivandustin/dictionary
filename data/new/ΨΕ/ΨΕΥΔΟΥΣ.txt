Etymology: The word "ψευδος" (pseudos) comes from the Greek language and means "false" or "deceptive". The word "εὐδοῦς" (eudous) is a combination of the prefix "εὖ" (eu), meaning "good" or "well", and the root "δοῦς" (dous), meaning "giving" or "producing". Therefore, "ψευδοδοῦς" (pseudodous) can be translated as "false-giving" or "deceptive-producing".

For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun, it will take the form "ψευδοδοῦς" (pseudodous), while if it modifies a feminine plural noun, it will take the form "ψευδοδοῦσαι" (pseudodousai).
