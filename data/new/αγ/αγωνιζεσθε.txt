Description: αγωνιζεσθε is a verb that is often used in the New Testament to encourage Christians to persevere in their faith and to fight against sin and temptation. It is translated as "fight" or "strive" in English and is used in verses such as 1 Corinthians 9:25, where Paul writes, "Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."
