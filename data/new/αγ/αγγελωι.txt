I'm sorry, but the word "αγγελωι" is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "αγγελία" (angelia), which means "announcement" or "message". 

Etymology: The word "αγγελία" comes from the Greek verb "αγγέλλω" (angello), which means "to announce" or "to proclaim". 

Grammar: "Αγγελία" is a feminine noun in Greek and belongs to the first declension. 

Description: "Αγγελία" can refer to various types of announcements or messages, such as news, advertisements, or official notices. It can also refer to the act of announcing or proclaiming something.
