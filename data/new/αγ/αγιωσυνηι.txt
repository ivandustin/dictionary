I'm sorry, but the word "αγιωσυνηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "αγιότητα" (agiótita), which means "holiness" or "sanctity". 

Etymology: The word "αγιότητα" comes from the adjective "άγιος" (ágios), which means "holy" or "saintly". 

Grammar: "Αγιότητα" is a feminine noun in the singular form. 

Description: "Αγιότητα" refers to the state or quality of being holy or sacred. It is often used in religious contexts to describe the holiness of God or of saints.
