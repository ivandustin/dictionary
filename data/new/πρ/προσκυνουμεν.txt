Word: προσκυνούμεν (proskynoumen)

Etymology: The word προσκυνούμεν comes from the Greek verb προσκυνέω (proskynéo), which means "to worship" or "to bow down in reverence." The suffix -μεν (-men) is added to the end of the verb to indicate that it is in the present tense and that the subject is plural.

Grammar: προσκυνούμεν is a present participle in the passive voice. It is formed by adding the suffix -ούμεν (-oumen) to the present stem of the verb προσκυνέω (proskynéo). The passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.

Description: προσκυνούμεν is a Greek word that is often used in religious contexts to describe the act of worship or reverence. It can also be used more broadly to describe any act of showing respect or deference to someone or something. In English, it is often translated as "we worship" or "we bow down."
