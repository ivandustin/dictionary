Word: πρωτοτοκον

Etymology: πρωτοτοκον comes from the Greek words πρῶτος (prōtos) meaning "first" and τόκος (tokos) meaning "childbirth" or "offspring". Therefore, the word πρωτοτοκον means "firstborn" or "first offspring".

Grammar: πρωτοτοκον is a neuter noun in the singular form. In Greek, neuter nouns have the same form for both the nominative and accusative cases. The word can also be declined in other cases, such as genitive, dative, and vocative.

Description: πρωτοτοκον is a term used in the Bible to refer to the firstborn son in a family. In ancient times, the firstborn son was considered to be the most important and was often given special privileges and responsibilities. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the πρωτοτοκον τῆς κτίσεως (prōtotokon tēs ktiseōs), which means "the firstborn of all creation". This phrase is used to emphasize Jesus' preeminence and authority over all things.
