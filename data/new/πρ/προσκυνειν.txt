Word: προσκυνειν

Etymology:
The word προσκυνειν (proskunein) is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: προς (pros), meaning "toward," and κυνειν (kynein), meaning "to kiss." The original meaning of the word was to kiss someone's hand or feet as a sign of respect or worship. Over time, the meaning of the word evolved to include other forms of worship, such as bowing or prostrating oneself before a deity or a person of higher status.

Grammar:
προσκυνειν is a present active infinitive verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -ειν (-ein) to the stem προσκυν- (proskyn-). The verb is conjugated in the present tense as follows:

- Προσκυνώ (proskynó) - I worship
- Προσκυνείς (proskyneís) - You worship
- Προσκυνεί (proskyneí) - He/she/it worships
- Προσκυνούμε (proskynoúme) - We worship
- Προσκυνείτε (proskyneíte) - You (plural) worship
- Προσκυνούν (proskynoún) - They worship

Description:
προσκυνειν is a verb that describes an act of worship or reverence. It can be used in a religious context, to describe the act of worshiping a deity, or in a secular context, to describe the act of showing respect or deference to a person of higher status. The word carries connotations of humility and submission, as it implies a recognition of one's own inferiority or dependence on the object of worship or reverence. In modern Greek, the word is still commonly used in religious contexts, but it can also be used more broadly to describe any act of showing respect or admiration.
