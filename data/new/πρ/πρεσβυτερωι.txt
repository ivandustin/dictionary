I'm sorry, but the word "πρεσβυτερωι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling or a non-standard variation of the word "πρεσβύτεροι" (presbyteroi), which means "elders" or "priests" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "πρεσβύτεροι" comes from the Greek word "πρέσβυς" (presbus), which means "old man" or "elder". 

Grammar: "πρεσβύτεροι" is a plural noun in the nominative case. 

Description: In ancient Greek society, "πρεσβύτεροι" referred to the elders or leaders of a community, often in a religious or political context. In the Christian tradition, "πρεσβύτεροι" are also known as "presbyters" or "priests" and are responsible for leading and guiding the church community.
