Word: προδηλον

Etymology:
The word προδηλον comes from the Greek prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in front of," and the adjective δῆλος (dēlos), meaning "clear" or "evident." Therefore, προδηλον means "clear beforehand" or "evident in advance."

Grammar:
προδηλον is an adjective in the neuter gender, singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree with the gender, number, and case of the noun they modify. Therefore, if used to modify a masculine or feminine noun, the adjective would change to προδηλος or προδηλη, respectively.

Description:
προδηλον is used to describe something that is clear or evident beforehand, or something that is obvious or apparent in advance. It can be used to describe a situation, an event, or a characteristic of a person or thing. For example, "It was προδηλον that the team would win the game," or "Her intelligence was προδηλον from a young age."
