Word: προσηνεχθη

Etymology:
The word προσηνεχθη is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: πρός (pros) meaning "towards" and ἐνέχω (enechō) meaning "to hold in". Therefore, the literal meaning of προσηνεχθη is "to be held towards".

Grammar:
προσηνεχθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the prefix προς- to the verb ἐνέχω and conjugating it in the aorist tense. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action.
