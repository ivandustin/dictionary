Word: πραεις

Etymology:
The word πραεις (praeis) is derived from the Greek word πραΰς (praus), which means gentle or meek. It is believed to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European root *preh₁u-, which means to bend or bow.

Grammar:
πραεις is an adjective in the masculine plural form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, if πραεις is used to describe a feminine noun, it would be πραείες (praeies) in the plural form.

Description:
πραεις is used to describe someone who is gentle, meek, or mild-mannered. It can also be used to describe a situation or behavior that is calm and peaceful. In Greek philosophy, the concept of πραΰτης (prautēs) or meekness was highly valued as a virtue. It was seen as a way to achieve inner peace and harmony with others.
