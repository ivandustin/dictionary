Description: The word προημαρτηκοσιν is not commonly used in modern Greek, but it appears in the New Testament of the Bible in Romans 3:9. In this verse, the Apostle Paul uses the word to describe the state of all humanity, saying that "all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin" and that "they are all under sin, as it is written: 'There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one.'" (NKJV)
