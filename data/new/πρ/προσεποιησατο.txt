Word: προσεποιησατο

Etymology: The word προσεποιησατο comes from the Greek verb προσποιέομαι (prospoieomai), which means "to pretend" or "to feign". The prefix προσ- (pros-) means "towards" or "in addition to", while the root ποιέω (poieo) means "to make" or "to do". Therefore, προσεποιησατο can be translated as "he made towards pretending" or "he added to his pretense".

Grammar: προσεποιησατο is a third-person singular aorist middle indicative verb in Ancient Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on himself. Therefore, προσεποιησατο can be translated as "he pretended to himself" or "he feigned for himself".
