Word: προεθεμην

Etymology:
The word προεθεμην is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before," and the verb ἐθέμην (ethemen), meaning "I placed" or "I set." Therefore, the word προεθεμην can be translated as "I set before" or "I placed before."

Grammar:
προεθεμην is a first-person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb ἐθέμην (ethemen). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement or asking a question. The active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description:
προεθεμην is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in 1 Corinthians 15:3. In this passage, the apostle Paul is summarizing the gospel message, stating that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. The word προεθεμην is used to indicate that this message was passed down to Paul from others before him, and that he is now passing it on to the Corinthians. The word emphasizes the idea of tradition and the passing down of knowledge from one generation to the next.
