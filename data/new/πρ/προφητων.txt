Word: προφητων

Etymology:
The word προφητων (prophētōn) is a Greek word that is derived from the verb προφητεύω (prophēteuō), which means "to prophesy" or "to speak forth." The word is a combination of two Greek words: πρό (pro), which means "before," and φημί (phēmi), which means "to speak." Therefore, the word προφητων can be translated as "those who speak before" or "those who speak forth."

Grammar:
In Greek, προφητων is the genitive plural form of the noun προφήτης (prophētēs), which means "prophet." The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and in this case, it indicates that the noun is plural and that it is in the possessive form. Therefore, the word προφητων can be translated as "of the prophets."

Description:
The word προφητων is used in the New Testament of the Bible to refer to the prophets of the Old Testament. These were individuals who were believed to have been chosen by God to speak on His behalf and to deliver messages to the people. The prophets were often seen as intermediaries between God and humanity, and their messages were often warnings of impending judgment or calls to repentance. The word προφητων is also used in a broader sense to refer to anyone who speaks on behalf of God or who delivers a message from Him.
