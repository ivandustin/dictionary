Word: προειρηκαμεν

Etymology:
The word προειρηκαμεν (proeirēkamen) is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before," and the verb εἴρηκα (eirēka), meaning "I have said." The prefix προ- indicates that the action of the verb took place before the time of speaking or writing.

Grammar:
προειρηκαμεν is a first-person plural perfect active indicative verb in ancient Greek. The perfect tense indicates that the action of the verb was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
προειρηκαμεν is a rare and complex word that appears only once in the New Testament (Romans 3:9). It is translated as "we have already charged" or "we have already accused." The word is used to emphasize that the Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin and in need of salvation. The use of the perfect tense suggests that the charge against humanity has been made in the past and still stands in the present.
