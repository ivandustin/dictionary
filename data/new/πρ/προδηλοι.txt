Word: προδηλοι

Etymology: The word προδηλοι comes from the Greek prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in front of," and the adjective δῆλος (dēlos), meaning "clear" or "evident." Together, they form the adjective προδηλοι (prodēloi), which means "clear beforehand" or "evident in advance."

Grammar: προδηλοι is a plural adjective in the masculine gender, agreeing with the noun it modifies. It is declined like the third declension adjective δῆλος (dēlos), with the nominative plural form being προδηλοι.

Description: προδηλοι is used to describe something that is clear or evident beforehand, or something that is already known or expected. It can also be used to describe a person who is known to be dishonest or untrustworthy. In modern Greek, the word is often used in legal contexts to describe evidence that is clear and indisputable.
