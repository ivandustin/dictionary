Word: προορισας

Etymology:
The word προορισας comes from the Greek verb προορίζω (proorizo), which means "to predetermine" or "to predestine". It is derived from the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before", and the verb ὁρίζω (horizo), meaning "to define" or "to limit".

Grammar:
προορισας is the aorist active indicative second person singular form of the verb προορίζω (proorizo). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
προορισας can be translated as "you predetermined" or "you predestined". It implies that the subject of the verb has made a decision or set a course of action in advance, before the event or situation in question has occurred. The word is often used in a theological context to refer to the idea of predestination, or the belief that God has predetermined the fate of individuals or groups.
