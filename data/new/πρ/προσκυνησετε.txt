Word: προσκυνησετε

Etymology:
The word προσκυνησετε comes from the Greek verb προσκυνέω (proskynéō), which means "to worship" or "to bow down in reverence." The word is derived from the prefix προς (pros), meaning "toward," and the verb κυνέω (kynéō), meaning "to kiss." In ancient Greece, it was customary to kiss the ground in front of someone as a sign of respect or worship, and this act eventually evolved into the modern meaning of the word.

Grammar:
προσκυνησετε is a verb in the second person plural form of the aorist tense in the Greek language. It is a command form, meaning "you all worship" or "you all bow down in reverence." The verb is formed by adding the suffix -ετε (-ete) to the stem προσκυνησ- (proskynēs-).
