Word: προσδεχεσθε

Etymology:
The word προσδεχεσθε (prosdechesthe) is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: προς (pros), which means "toward" or "to," and δεχομαι (dechomai), which means "to receive" or "to accept." Therefore, the literal meaning of προσδεχεσθε is "to receive towards oneself" or "to accept towards oneself."

Grammar:
προσδεχεσθε is a second-person plural present middle/passive imperative verb in Greek. This means that it is a command directed to a group of people, telling them to receive or accept something towards themselves. The middle/passive voice indicates that the action is being done to or for the subject, rather than by the subject.

Description:
προσδεχεσθε is a verb that is often used in the New Testament of the Bible, where it is translated as "welcome" or "receive." It is used in the context of welcoming or receiving someone or something, such as a guest or a message. In modern Greek, it is still used in the same way, as a polite way of welcoming someone or something.
