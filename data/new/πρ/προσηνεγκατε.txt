Word: προσηνεγκατε

Etymology: The word προσηνεγκατε is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: πρός (pros), which means "toward" or "to," and ἀναφέρω (anapherō), which means "to bring up" or "to offer." Therefore, the literal meaning of προσηνεγκατε is "you brought up/offered to."

Grammar: προσηνεγκατε is the second person plural aorist active indicative form of the Greek verb ἀναφέρω (anapherō). This means that it is used to describe an action that was completed in the past by a group of people (in this case, "you all"). The verb is in the active voice, which means that the subject (you all) is performing the action.

The verb emphasizes the act of bringing or offering something to someone or something. In the context of the Bible, it often refers to bringing offerings to God or making sacrifices.
