Word: προσηλθεν

Etymology:
The word προσηλθεν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: πρός (pros) meaning "towards" and ἥκω (hēkō) meaning "to come". Therefore, προσηλθεν means "he/she/it came towards".

Grammar:
προσηλθεν is the aorist tense of the Greek verb προσέρχομαι (proserchomai), which means "to come towards" or "to approach". The aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating its duration or repetition. In this case, προσηλθεν indicates that someone came towards a specific place or person at a specific time in the past.

Description:
προσηλθεν is a verb that describes an action of someone coming towards a specific place or person. It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the actions of Jesus or his disciples approaching someone or a group of people. For example, in Mark 1:40, it is written: "And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, 'If you will, you can make me clean.'" Here, the verb προσηλθεν is translated as "came to him", indicating that the leper approached Jesus.
