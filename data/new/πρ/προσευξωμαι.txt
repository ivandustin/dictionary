Word: προσευξωμαι

Etymology: The word προσευξωμαι comes from the Greek verb προσεύχομαι (proseúkhomai), which means "to pray" or "to offer prayers." The word is derived from the prefix προς- (pros-), which means "toward," and the verb εὔχομαι (eúkhomai), which means "to pray" or "to vow."

Grammar: προσευξωμαι is a first-person singular, present middle/passive indicative form of the verb προσεύχομαι. The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. In this case, the subject is the person who is praying, and the action is the act of praying.
