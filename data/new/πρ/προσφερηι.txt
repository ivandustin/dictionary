Grammar: "Προσφορά" is a feminine noun in Greek and belongs to the first declension. 

Description: "Προσφορά" is a common word in Greek and is often used in religious contexts to refer to offerings made to the gods or to the church. It can also be used more generally to refer to any kind of offering or sacrifice.
