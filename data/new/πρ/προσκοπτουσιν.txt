The word "προσκοπτουσιν" is a present participle in Greek, which means "they stumble" or "they cause to stumble". It is derived from the verb "προσκόπτω" (proskopto), which means "to stumble" or "to trip". The word is often used in a metaphorical sense to describe someone who causes others to stumble or fall, either physically or morally. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe those who cause others to sin or fall away from their faith.
