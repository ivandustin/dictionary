Word: προσηλώσας

Etymology: The word προσηλώσας comes from the Greek verb προσηλώνω (prosilonó), which means "to fasten, to attach firmly". It is formed by combining the prefix προσ- (pros-), which means "towards" or "at", and the verb ἡλώνω (ilonó), which means "to nail, to fix".

Grammar: προσηλώσας is a verb in the aorist tense, active voice, and second person singular form. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the second person singular form indicates that the subject is the person being addressed.

Description: προσηλώσας can be translated as "you attached firmly" or "you fastened". It implies a strong and secure attachment, as if something has been nailed or fixed in place. The word can be used in a literal sense, such as fastening a piece of wood to a wall, or in a figurative sense, such as being firmly committed to a belief or idea.
