Word: προορωμην

Etymology:
The word προορωμην (prooromen) is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before," and the verb ὁράω (horaō), meaning "to see." Therefore, the word προορωμην can be translated as "to see beforehand" or "to predict."

Grammar:
προορωμην is a first-person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb προοράω (proorao), which means "to foresee" or "to predict." In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition.

Description:
προορωμην is a word that refers to the act of predicting or foreseeing something before it happens. It is often used in the context of prophecy or divination, and can also be used more generally to describe the act of anticipating or preparing for something in advance. In ancient Greek literature, the word is often associated with the gods or with supernatural powers, as the ability to predict the future was seen as a divine gift.
