Word: προσωπου

Etymology: The word προσωπου (prosopou) comes from the Greek word πρόσωπον (prosopon), which means "face" or "countenance". It is derived from the combination of the preposition πρός (pros), meaning "toward", and the noun ὤψ (ops), meaning "eye" or "face".

Grammar: προσωπου is a noun in the genitive case, which is used to indicate possession or relationship. In Greek, the genitive case is often used to show the relationship between two nouns, with the genitive noun indicating the possessor or source of the other noun. For example, in the phrase "το βιβλίο του προσωπου" (to vivlio tou prosopou), which means "the book of the face", the genitive noun προσωπου indicates that the book belongs to or is related to the face.

Description: προσωπου refers to the face or countenance of a person or animal. It can also be used to refer to the front or surface of an object. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo was often depicted with a radiant προσωπου, symbolizing his beauty and power. The word is commonly used in modern Greek to refer to the face or facial features, as well as to describe the appearance or expression of a person.
