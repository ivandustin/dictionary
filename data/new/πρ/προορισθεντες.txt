Word: προορισθεντες

Etymology: The word προορισθεντες is a Greek verb that comes from the root word προορίζω (proorizo), which means "to predestine" or "to determine beforehand." The suffix -θεντες (-thentes) is a passive participle ending, indicating that the subject of the verb is being acted upon.

Grammar: προορισθεντες is a passive participle in the nominative plural form. It is derived from the verb προορίζω, which is a compound verb made up of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before," and the verb ὁρίζω (horizo), meaning "to define" or "to determine." The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action themselves.

Description: προορισθεντες can be translated as "predestined" or "foreordained." It is often used in a theological context to refer to the idea that certain events or individuals have been predetermined by a higher power. In the New Testament, the word is used to describe believers who have been chosen by God for salvation (Romans 8:29-30, Ephesians 1:5, 11).
