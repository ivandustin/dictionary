Word: προσετιθεντο

Etymology: προσετιθεντο is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of the prefix προς (pros), meaning "toward" or "in addition to," and the verb τιθημι (tithemi), meaning "to place" or "to put." Therefore, προσετιθεντο can be translated as "they added" or "they placed in addition to."

Grammar: προσετιθεντο is the third person plural aorist indicative middle voice form of the verb προστιθημι (prostithemi), which means "to add" or "to place in addition to." The aorist tense indicates that the action was completed in the past, while the middle voice indicates that the subject was both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: προσετιθεντο is a verb that describes the act of adding or placing something in addition to something else. It can be used in various contexts, such as adding an extra ingredient to a recipe, adding a new clause to a contract, or adding a new feature to a product. The word emphasizes the idea of adding something extra or supplementary, rather than simply replacing or modifying what already exists.
