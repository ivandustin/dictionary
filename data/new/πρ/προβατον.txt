Word: προβατον

Etymology:
The word προβατον (pronounced "probaton") comes from the Greek language. It is derived from the word "πρό" (pro), meaning "before" or "in front of," and "βάτος" (batos), meaning "step" or "pace." Therefore, the literal meaning of προβατον is "that which goes before or leads the way."

Grammar:
In Greek, προβατον is a neuter noun, which means that it does not have a gender. It is also a second-declension noun, which means that its endings change depending on its function in a sentence. For example, in the nominative case (used for the subject of a sentence), it is προβατον. In the accusative case (used for the direct object of a sentence), it is προβατον.

Description:
προβατον is the Greek word for "sheep." It is used to refer to the domesticated mammal that is raised for its wool, meat, and milk. In ancient Greece, sheep were an important part of the economy and were often used in religious ceremonies. Today, sheep are still raised for their products and are also kept as pets or used in therapy programs. The word προβατον can also be used metaphorically to refer to a person who is easily led or follows others without thinking for themselves.
