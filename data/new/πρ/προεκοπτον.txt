Word: προεκοπτον

Etymology:
The word προεκοπτον is a Greek verb that comes from the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in front of," and the verb εκοπτω (ekopto), meaning "to cut off" or "to strike." Therefore, the literal meaning of προεκοπτον is "to cut off beforehand" or "to strike before."

Grammar:
προεκοπτον is a verb in the imperfect tense, active voice, and indicative mood. In Greek, the imperfect tense is used to describe ongoing or repeated actions in the past. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood is used to make a statement or ask a question.

Description:
προεκοπτον is not a commonly used word in modern Greek. It appears in the New Testament of the Bible in the book of Acts (9:20), where it is used to describe how Saul (later known as Paul) "began immediately to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying that he is the Son of God." The use of the imperfect tense in this context suggests that Saul's preaching was ongoing or repeated. 

Overall, προεκοπτον is a word that describes an action of cutting off or striking before something else happens. Its use in the New Testament highlights the importance of proclaiming one's beliefs and spreading the word of God.
