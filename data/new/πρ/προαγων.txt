Word: προαγων

Etymology:
The word προαγων (proagon) is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in front of," and the verb ἀγωνίζομαι (agonizomai), meaning "to struggle" or "to contend." Therefore, the literal meaning of προαγων is "one who struggles before" or "one who contends in advance."

Grammar:
In Greek, προαγων is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive προαγωνος (proagonos) or the accusative προαγωνα (proagona).

Description:
In ancient Greek culture, the term προαγων referred to an athlete who competed in preliminary contests before the main event. These preliminary contests were held to determine which athletes were qualified to participate in the main event. The term was also used in a broader sense to refer to anyone who was a forerunner or a precursor to something else. In modern Greek, the term προαγων is still used in sports to refer to preliminary contests or qualifying rounds.
