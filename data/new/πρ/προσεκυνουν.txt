Word: προσεκυνούν (prosekynoún)

Etymology: The word προσεκυνούν comes from the Greek verb προσκυνέω (proskynéō), which means "to worship" or "to bow down in reverence." The prefix προς (pros) means "toward" or "in the direction of," while κυνέω (kynéō) means "to kiss" or "to fawn over." Together, the word προσκυνέω conveys the idea of showing reverence or adoration by bowing down or kissing the ground.

Grammar: προσεκυνούν is the present tense, third person plural form of the verb προσκυνέω. It is a regular verb in the Greek language, and its conjugation follows the pattern of other verbs that end in -έω.

Description: προσεκυνούν is a word that describes an act of worship or reverence. It is often used in a religious context to describe the act of bowing down or prostrating oneself before a deity or holy object. In Greek Orthodox Christianity, for example, the faithful may prostrate themselves before icons or during certain parts of the liturgy. The word can also be used more broadly to describe any act of deep respect or admiration, such as when one bows to a king or queen.
