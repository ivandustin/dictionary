Word: προσεδεχετο

Etymology:
The word προσεδεχετο (prosedecheto) is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: προς (pros), which means "toward" or "to," and εδεχετο (edecheto), which means "to receive" or "to welcome." Therefore, the word προσεδεχετο can be translated as "to welcome" or "to receive warmly."

Grammar:
προσεδεχετο is a third-person singular, imperfect, middle-passive indicative verb in Ancient Greek. It belongs to the first conjugation of verbs, which means that it has the stem prosedech- and the ending -eto. The middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, and the imperfect tense indicates that the action was ongoing in the past.
