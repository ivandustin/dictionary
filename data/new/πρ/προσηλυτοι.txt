Description:
προσηλυτοι is a term used in the New Testament to refer to Gentile converts to Judaism. These were people who were not born Jewish but had converted to Judaism and were now living as Jews. The term is used in contrast to the term "born Jews" or "native Jews." In the New Testament, the apostle Paul often refers to himself as a προσηλυτος, as he was a Jew who had converted to Christianity. The term is also used in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, to refer to foreigners who had converted to Judaism.
