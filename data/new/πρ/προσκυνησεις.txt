Description: προσκυνήσεις refers to acts of worship or reverence, such as bowing down, kneeling, or prostrating oneself before a deity or a person of high status. In Greek Orthodox Christianity, προσκυνήσεις are a common form of prayer and devotion, often accompanied by the crossing of oneself and the recitation of prayers. The word can also be used more broadly to refer to acts of respect or deference towards someone or something.
