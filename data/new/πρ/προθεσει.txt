The word "προθεσει" (prothesi) is a Greek noun that means "a placing before, a preposition." 

Etymology: The word is derived from the Greek verb "προτίθημι" (protithemi), which means "to place before, to propose." The noun form "πρόθεσις" (prothesis) means "a proposal, a purpose, an intention." 

Grammar: "Προθεσει" is in the singular nominative case. In Greek grammar, prepositions are declined like nouns, and their form changes depending on the case, number, and gender of the noun they modify. 

Description: In Greek, prepositions are used to indicate the relationship between two words in a sentence. They usually come before a noun or pronoun and show the noun's relationship to another word in the sentence. For example, in the sentence "Πήγα στο σχολείο" (Piga sto scholeio), the preposition "στο" (sto) means "to" and shows the relationship between the verb "πήγα" (piga) and the noun "σχολείο" (scholeio), meaning "school."
