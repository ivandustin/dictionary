Word: προσεθηκεν

Etymology: προσεθηκεν is a Greek word that comes from the verb προστίθημι (prostithēmi), which means "to add" or "to place upon". The word is formed by adding the prefix προς (pros), which means "towards" or "in addition to", to the verb stem θηκ (thēk).

Grammar: προσεθηκεν is the third person singular aorist indicative active form of the verb προστίθημι (prostithēmi). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The indicative mood indicates that the speaker is making a statement or asking a question about a fact, rather than expressing a wish or a command. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.

Description: προσεθηκεν means "he/she/it added" or "he/she/it placed upon" in English. The word is often used in the context of adding something to a list, a collection, or a group. It can also be used to describe the act of placing something on top of something else. For example, in the New Testament of the Bible, the word is used to describe how Jesus added more disciples to his group of followers.
