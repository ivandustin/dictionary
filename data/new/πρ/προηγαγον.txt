Word: προηγαγον

Etymology:
The word προηγαγον comes from the Greek verb προάγω (proago), which is a compound of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in front of," and the verb άγω (ago), meaning "I lead" or "I bring." Therefore, προηγαγον means "I led forward" or "I brought forward."

Grammar:
προηγαγον is the aorist tense of the Greek verb προάγω (proago), which means "I lead forward" or "I bring forward." The aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. In this case, προηγαγον describes a single action of leading or bringing something forward in the past.

Description:
προηγαγον is a Greek verb that is used in the New Testament of the Bible. It appears in several passages, including Matthew 27:2, Mark 15:1, and Luke 23:1, where it is used to describe the action of leading Jesus before Pilate. In these passages, προηγαγον is translated as "they brought" or "they led" Jesus before Pilate. The verb emphasizes the idea that Jesus was brought forward or led to Pilate, indicating that he was under the control of those who brought him.
