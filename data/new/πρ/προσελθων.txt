Word: προσελθων

Etymology:
The word προσελθων is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: πρός (pros) meaning "towards" and ἔρχομαι (erchomai) meaning "to come". Therefore, προσελθων means "having come towards" or "having approached".

Grammar:
προσελθων is the aorist participle of the Greek verb προσέρχομαι (proserchomai), which means "to come near" or "to approach". The aorist tense in Greek refers to a past action that is completed, and the participle form functions as an adjective. Therefore, προσελθων can be translated as "having come near" or "having approached".

Description:
προσελθων is a word that describes an action that has already taken place in the past. It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe someone who has come near to Jesus or to God. For example, in Mark 5:27, a woman who had been suffering from bleeding for 12 years "came up behind [Jesus] in the crowd and touched his cloak" (προσελθοῦσα ἐν τῷ ὄχλῳ ὄπισθεν ἥψατο τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ). In this context, προσελθων emphasizes the woman's action of approaching Jesus and touching his cloak.
