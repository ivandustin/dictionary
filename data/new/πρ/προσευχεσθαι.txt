Word: προσευχεσθαι

Etymology:
The word προσευχεσθαι (proseuchesthai) is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: προς (pros) meaning "toward" or "to" and εὐχή (euchē) meaning "prayer". Therefore, the word προσευχεσθαι means "to pray" or "to offer a prayer".

Grammar:
προσευχεσθαι is a present middle/passive infinitive verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -εσθαι (-esthai) to the present stem of the verb προσευχ- (proseuch-). The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action, or that the action is being done to or for the subject.

Description:
προσευχεσθαι is a word that has a strong religious connotation, as it refers to the act of praying or offering a prayer. In the New Testament, it is used to describe the act of communicating with God, expressing gratitude, asking for forgiveness, or making requests. The word emphasizes the idea of approaching God with reverence and humility, acknowledging His sovereignty and seeking His will. In modern Greek, the word is still used to refer to the act of praying, both in a religious and a secular context.
