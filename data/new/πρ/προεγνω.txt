Word: προεγνω

Etymology:
The word προεγνω is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in advance," and the verb εγνω (egno), meaning "to know." Therefore, προεγνω means "to know beforehand" or "to have foreknowledge."

Grammar:
προεγνω is a verb in the Greek language, specifically in the aorist tense. It is conjugated in the third person singular form, which means that it refers to a single subject who performed the action in the past. The verb is also active, indicating that the subject performed the action rather than receiving it.

Description:
προεγνω is a term used in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the writings of the apostle Peter. It is often translated as "foreknew" or "foreknowledge" and is used to describe God's knowledge of future events or people. In Christian theology, the concept of God's foreknowledge is often linked to the idea of predestination, which suggests that God has predetermined the fate of individuals based on his foreknowledge.
