Word: προσανεπληρώσαν (prosaneplyphrosan)

Etymology: The word προσανεπληρώσαν is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix προσ- (pros-), meaning "towards" or "in addition to," and the verb ἀναπληρόω (anapleroo), meaning "to fill up" or "to complete." Therefore, the word προσανεπληρώσαν means "to fill up in addition to" or "to complete further."

Grammar: προσανεπληρώσαν is a verb in the aorist tense, third person plural, active voice, indicative mood. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The third person plural indicates that the subject of the verb is a group of people, and the active voice indicates that the subject is performing the action.

Description: προσανεπληρώσαν is a rare and complex word in Greek, used to describe the act of filling up or completing something further. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context, such as in the New Testament of the Bible, where it is used to describe the completion of a prophecy or the fulfillment of a promise. The word can also be used in a more general sense, to describe the act of adding to or completing something that is already present.
