I'm sorry, but I cannot define the word "πρωτωι" as it is not a valid Greek word. It is possible that you meant to type "πρωτοί", which is the plural form of the Greek word "πρώτος" (prótos), meaning "first" or "primary". 

Etymology: The word "πρώτος" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *per-, meaning "forward" or "in front". It is related to the English words "first" and "foremost".

Grammar: "πρώτος" is an adjective in Greek, and it agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, "πρώτοι άνθρωποι" (prótoi ánthropoi) means "first humans", where "πρώτοι" is the masculine plural form of the adjective.

Description: "πρώτος" is a common and versatile word in Greek, used in a variety of contexts to indicate primacy, importance, or precedence. It can also be used as an adverb to mean "firstly" or "initially".
