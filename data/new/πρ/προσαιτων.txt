Word: προσαιτων

Etymology: The word προσαιτων comes from the Greek words πρός (pros) meaning "towards" and αἰτέω (aiteo) meaning "to ask" or "to beg". Therefore, the word προσαιτων means "one who asks/begs towards".

Grammar: προσαιτων is a noun in the masculine gender and the nominative case. It is the present participle of the verb αἰτέω (aiteo), which means "to ask" or "to beg". As a present participle, it indicates ongoing action, so προσαιτων can be translated as "one who is asking/begging towards".

It is often used in a negative context to describe someone who is seen as a nuisance or a burden on society. In Homer's Odyssey, the character of Odysseus disguises himself as a προσαιτων in order to test the hospitality of his own people.
