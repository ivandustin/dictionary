Word: προενηρξατο

Etymology: The word προενηρξατο is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in advance," and the verb ενηρξατο (enērxato), meaning "began" or "commenced." Therefore, the word προενηρξατο means "began beforehand" or "started in advance."

Grammar: προενηρξατο is a third-person singular aorist indicative active verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the prefix προ- to the verb ενηρξατο, which is in the aorist tense, indicating a completed action in the past. The indicative mood indicates a statement of fact, and the active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action.

Description: προενηρξατο is a rare word in Greek, found only once in the New Testament (Hebrews 7:11). In this context, it is used to describe the priesthood of Melchizedek, who "began beforehand" or "started in advance" of the Levitical priesthood. The word emphasizes the superiority of Melchizedek's priesthood over the Levitical priesthood, as he was not bound by the limitations of the Mosaic law.
