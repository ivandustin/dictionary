Word: προστεθηναι

Etymology:
The word προστεθηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: πρός (pros) meaning "towards" or "in addition to" and τίθημι (tithemi) meaning "to put" or "to place". Therefore, the literal meaning of προστεθηναι is "to be placed towards" or "to be added to".

Grammar:
προστεθηναι is a passive aorist infinitive verb in Greek. In English, it can be translated as "to be added" or "to be included". The verb is formed by adding the prefix προς (pros) to the verb τιθημι (tithemi) and then adding the aorist ending -ηναι (-enai).
