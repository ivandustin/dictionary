Word: προεδραμεν

Etymology: προ- (pro-, meaning "before" or "in front of") + ἡγέομαι (hēgéomai, meaning "to lead" or "to guide"). Therefore, προεδραμεν means "to have led before" or "to have guided previously".

Grammar: προεδραμεν is the aorist tense of the Greek verb προεδράω (proedráō), which means "to preside over" or "to be in charge of". It is in the first person singular form.

Description: προεδραμεν is a rare word that appears only once in the New Testament (1 Thessalonians 3:4). In this context, it is used to describe how Paul and his companions had previously led and guided the Thessalonians in their faith. The word carries a sense of authority and responsibility, suggesting that the person who has προεδραμεν has taken charge and provided direction.
