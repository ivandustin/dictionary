Word: προεπηγγειλατο

Etymology:
The word προεπηγγειλατο is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in advance," and the verb επαγγέλλομαι (epangelomai), meaning "to promise" or "to announce." Therefore, the word προεπηγγειλατο means "he had promised beforehand" or "he had announced in advance."

Grammar:
προεπηγγειλατο is a third-person singular aorist middle indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a past action that is viewed as a whole, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is acting upon himself or herself. Therefore, the word προεπηγγειλατο can be translated as "he had promised to himself beforehand" or "he had announced in advance to himself."

Description:
