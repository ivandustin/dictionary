For example, in James 1:22, the phrase "be doers of the word" is translated from the Greek phrase γινεσθε δε ποιηται λογου (ginesthe de poietai logou), which literally means "become doers of the word". The word πρασσων is also used in the phrase "πρασσων το αγαθον" (prasson to agathon), which means "doing good".
