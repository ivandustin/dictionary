The word προελθωσιν is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: προ (pro), meaning "before" or "in front of," and ἔρχομαι (erchomai), meaning "to come." Therefore, the literal meaning of προελθωσιν is "to come before" or "to precede."

The aorist tense refers to a past action that is viewed as a whole, while the subjunctive mood expresses doubt, uncertainty, or a hypothetical situation.

Description:
