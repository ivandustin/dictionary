Word: πραυς

Etymology:
The word πραυς (praus) comes from the Greek root πραΰς (praus), which means gentle, meek, or mild. It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *preh₁u-, which means to bend or incline.

Grammar:
πραυς is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree with the gender, number, and case of the noun they modify. For example, πραυς can be used to describe a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, such as ἄνθρωπος (anthropos), meaning man. In this case, the phrase would be πραυς ἄνθρωπος (praus anthropos), which means gentle man.

Description:
πραυς is a word that describes someone who is gentle, meek, or mild. It can be used to describe a person's character or behavior. In the New Testament, Jesus uses the word πραυς to describe himself in Matthew 11:29, saying "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle (πραυς) and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." The word is also used in the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:5, where Jesus says "Blessed are the meek (πραεις), for they will inherit the earth."
