Word: προσετεθη

Etymology: προσετεθη is a Greek word that comes from the verb προστίθημι (prostithemi), which means "to add" or "to place upon". The prefix προσ- (pros-) means "towards" or "in addition to", while the root word τίθημι (tithemi) means "to place" or "to set".

Grammar: προσετεθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb προστίθημι (prostithemi). In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description: προσετεθη can be translated to English as "was added" or "was placed upon". It is often used in a figurative sense to describe the addition of something to a situation or the imposition of a burden or responsibility. For example, in the New Testament, the word is used to describe the addition of new believers to the early Christian community (Acts 2:41) and the imposition of the Mosaic law upon the Jewish people (Galatians 3:19).
