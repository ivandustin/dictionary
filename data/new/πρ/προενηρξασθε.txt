Word: προενηρξασθε

Etymology: The word προενηρξασθε is a compound word in Greek, consisting of the prefix προ- (pro-), meaning "before" or "in front of," and the verb ενηρξασθε (enērxasthe), meaning "began" or "started." Therefore, the word προενηρξασθε can be translated as "you began beforehand" or "you started before."

Grammar: προενηρξασθε is a second-person plural aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action. The indicative mood indicates a statement of fact or reality. Therefore, the word προενηρξασθε can be translated as "you all were started beforehand" or "you all began before."

Description: προενηρξασθε is a rare and complex word in Greek, found only once in the New Testament in 2 Corinthians 8:6. In this passage, the word is used to describe the generosity of the Macedonian churches, who "begged us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints." The word emphasizes the eagerness and enthusiasm of the Macedonians to participate in this charitable work, suggesting that they had already begun to contribute even before being asked.
