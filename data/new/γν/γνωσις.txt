The word γνωσις (gnosis) is a Greek word that means "knowledge" or "understanding". It comes from the verb γιγνώσκω (gignósko), which means "to know" or "to recognize".

Grammar:
In Greek, γνωσις is a feminine noun of the first declension. Its nominative singular form is γνῶσις (gnōsis), and its genitive singular form is γνώσεως (gnōseōs).

Description:
In ancient Greek philosophy, γνωσις (gnosis) referred to a type of knowledge that was considered to be superior to mere opinion or belief. It was a knowledge that was gained through direct experience or intuition, rather than through logical deduction or empirical observation. This concept of gnosis was particularly important in the philosophy of Plato and the Neoplatonists, who believed that true knowledge of the world could only be attained through a process of spiritual purification and contemplation. In later Christian theology, the term gnosis was used to refer to a type of mystical knowledge that was believed to be necessary for salvation.
