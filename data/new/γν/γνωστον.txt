Word: γνωστόν

Etymology:
The word γνωστόν (gnōstón) is derived from the Greek verb γιγνώσκω (gignṓskō), which means "to know" or "to recognize." The suffix -τόν (-tón) is added to the verb stem to form an adjective, which means "known" or "recognized."

Grammar:
γνωστόν is a neuter singular adjective in the nominative case. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. Therefore, γνωστόν can modify a neuter singular noun in the nominative case.

Description:
γνωστόν is an adjective that describes something that is known or recognized. It can be used to describe a person, place, thing, or idea. For example, in the sentence "Το γνωστόν πρόβλημα είναι η έλλειψη χρημάτων" (To gnōstón problēma eínai ē élleipsē chrimátōn), which means "The known problem is the lack of money," γνωστόν describes the problem as something that is recognized or acknowledged.
