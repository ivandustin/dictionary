Word: ασθενης

Etymology:
The word ασθενης (asthenes) comes from the Greek roots α- (a-) meaning "not" and σθενος (sthenos) meaning "strength". Therefore, the word ασθενης means "without strength" or "weak".

Grammar:
In Greek, ασθενης is an adjective that can be used to describe a person, object, or situation. It has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and three cases (nominative, genitive, and accusative). For example, ασθενής άνδρας (asthenis andras) means "weak man" in the nominative case, while ασθενούς γυναίκας (asthenous gynaikas) means "of a weak woman" in the genitive case.

Description:
The word ασθενης is often used in medical contexts to describe a person who is physically or mentally weak due to illness or injury. It can also be used more broadly to describe a situation or object that is lacking in strength or vitality. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo was sometimes referred to as ασθενης because he was weakened by his love for the mortal Daphne.
