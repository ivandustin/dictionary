I'm sorry, but the word "αστραπηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "αστραπή" which means "lightning" in English. 

Etymology: The word "αστραπή" comes from the ancient Greek word "ἀστραπή" (astrapé) which also means "lightning". 

Grammar: "αστραπή" is a feminine noun in Greek and its plural form is "αστραπές". 

Description: "αστραπή" is a natural phenomenon that occurs during thunderstorms. It is a sudden and powerful electrical discharge that travels through the air and produces a bright flash of light. Lightning can be dangerous and cause damage to buildings and other structures.
