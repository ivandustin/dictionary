Etymology:
The word ασβεστον comes from the Greek word ἄσβεστος (asbestos), which means "unquenchable" or "inextinguishable". It is derived from the negative prefix ἀ- (a-) and the verb σβέννυμι (svennumi), which means "to extinguish".

Grammar:
ασβεστον is a neuter noun in Greek. It is in the singular form and is used to refer to a specific type of mineral, which is commonly known as asbestos in English.

Description:
ασβεστον is a naturally occurring mineral that is composed of long, thin fibers. It is known for its heat-resistant properties and has been used for a variety of purposes throughout history, including in building materials, insulation, and textiles. However, it is also known to be a health hazard when its fibers are inhaled, as they can cause lung diseases such as asbestosis and mesothelioma. As a result, the use of asbestos has been heavily regulated in many countries.
