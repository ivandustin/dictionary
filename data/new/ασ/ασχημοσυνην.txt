Sorry, I cannot define the word "ασχημοσυνην" as it is not a valid Greek word. It seems to be a misspelling of the word "ασχημοσύνην" which means "ugliness" or "impropriety" in Greek. 

Etymology: The word "ασχημοσύνην" is derived from the Greek words "ασχήμων" (ashémon) meaning "ugly" or "unseemly" and "σύνη" (sýni) meaning "together" or "with".

Grammar: "ασχημοσύνην" is a feminine noun in the accusative case.

Description: "ασχημοσύνην" refers to the state or quality of being ugly or improper. It can be used to describe physical appearance, behavior, or actions that are considered unattractive or inappropriate.
