Description: νοουμενα is a philosophical term used in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly in the works of Plato and Aristotle. It refers to the objects of intellectual perception or understanding, as opposed to the objects of sense perception. In other words, νοουμενα are the abstract concepts and ideas that the mind can grasp, such as truth, beauty, justice, and goodness. The concept of νοουμενα is central to Platonic and Aristotelian metaphysics and epistemology, and it has had a significant influence on Western philosophy.
