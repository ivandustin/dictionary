Word: εχαρην

Etymology: εχαρην is a Greek verb that comes from the root word χαίρω (chairō), which means "to rejoice" or "to be glad". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to indicate the past tense, making εχαρην (echaren) mean "I rejoiced" or "I was glad".

Grammar: εχαρην is a first-person singular past tense verb in the indicative mood. In Greek, verbs change their endings to indicate tense, mood, and person. The -αρ- (-ar-) infix is added to the root χαίρω (chairō) to indicate the past tense. The -ην (-en) ending indicates the first-person singular.

Description: εχαρην is a word that expresses joy or happiness in the past. It is often used in religious or spiritual contexts, such as in the New Testament of the Bible. For example, in Luke 10:21, Jesus says, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will." The Greek word translated as "I thank" is εχαρην (echaren), indicating that Jesus was rejoicing or expressing gratitude for what had happened.
