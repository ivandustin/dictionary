Etymology: εχαλασθην is a Greek word that comes from the verb χαλάω (chalaó), which means "to loosen" or "to relax". The word is in the aorist passive tense, indicating that the action was completed in the past and that the subject received the action.

Grammar: εχαλασθην is a first-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb χαλάω (chalaó). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action rather than performing it.

It can be used in a physical sense, such as when a muscle relaxes, or in a metaphorical sense, such as when a person's attitude or demeanor becomes more relaxed.
