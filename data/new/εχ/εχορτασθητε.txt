Description:
εχορτασθητε is a word that appears in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of John 6:26. In this passage, Jesus has just fed a large crowd of people with only five loaves of bread and two fish. The people are amazed and follow him, hoping for more food. Jesus tells them that they should not be seeking physical food, but rather spiritual nourishment. He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal." (John 6:26-27, ESV) The word εχορτασθητε is used here to describe the people's physical satisfaction after eating the bread and fish. Jesus is urging them to seek something more meaningful and lasting than temporary physical satisfaction.
