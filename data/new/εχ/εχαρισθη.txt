Word: εχαρισθη

Etymology:
The word εχαρισθη is a Greek verb that comes from the root word χαρίζομαι (charizomai), which means "to show favor, to grant, to forgive." The prefix ε- (e-) in this word is a form of the verb εἰμί (eimi), which means "to be." Therefore, εχαρισθη can be translated as "he/she/it was favored/granted/forgiven."

Grammar:
εχαρισθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a past action that is viewed as a whole, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (he/she/it) received the action of the verb rather than performing it. 

Description:
εχαρισθη is a word that expresses the idea of being favored, granted, or forgiven. It is often used in a religious context to describe the forgiveness of sins or the granting of divine favor. In the New Testament, this word is used to describe the grace of God towards humanity, as in Ephesians 1:6-7: "to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace."
