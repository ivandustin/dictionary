Etymology: The word εχεις (echeis) is a conjugated form of the Greek verb έχω (echo), which means "to have" or "to hold". The verb έχω comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *seḱ-, which means "to hold, to have".

Grammar: εχεις is the second person singular form of the present indicative tense of the verb έχω. It is used to indicate that the subject (you) currently possess or hold something. In Greek, verbs are conjugated to match the person, number, and tense of the subject.
