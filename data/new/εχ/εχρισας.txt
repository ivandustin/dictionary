Word: εχρισας

Etymology: The word εχρισας comes from the Greek verb χρίω (chrió), which means "to anoint" or "to smear with oil". It is derived from the noun χρίσμα (chrísma), which means "anointing" or "ointment".

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.
