Word: εχαρισατο

Etymology:
The word εχαρισατο is a Greek verb that comes from the root word χαρίζομαι (charizomai), which means "to show favor, to grant, to forgive." The prefix ε- (e-) in this word is a form of the Greek verb εἰμί (eimi), which means "to be." Therefore, εχαρισατο can be translated as "he/she/it was favored/granted/forgiven."

Grammar:
εχαρισατο is a third-person singular aorist middle-passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a past action that is viewed as a whole, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, εχαρισατο can be translated as "he/she/it was favored/granted/forgiven (by himself/herself/itself)."

Description:
εχαρισατο is a verb that expresses an action of being favored, granted, or forgiven. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context, such as in the New Testament of the Bible. For example, in Ephesians 1:7, it is written, "In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace (χάριτος, charitos) which he lavished upon us." The word εχαρισατο emphasizes the idea that the subject was not just granted a favor or forgiveness, but that they were the recipient of a special grace or gift.
