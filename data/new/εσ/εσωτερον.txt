Word: εσωτερον

Etymology:
The word εσωτερον comes from the Greek word εσωτερος (esōteros), which means "inner" or "interior". It is derived from the prefix εσω- (esō-), meaning "inside" or "within", and the suffix -τερος (-teros), which is a comparative suffix meaning "more" or "other".

Grammar:
εσωτερον is a neuter singular adjective in the nominative case. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. The neuter gender is used when the noun being modified is neutral or when the gender is unknown or irrelevant. The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence or for a predicate nominative.
