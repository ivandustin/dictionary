Word: εσπειρα

Etymology:
The word εσπειρα (espira) comes from the Greek verb σπείρω (speíro), which means "to sow" or "to scatter seed". The prefix ε- (e-) is a common prefix in Greek that can indicate "good" or "well", so εσπειρα can be interpreted as "well-sown" or "well-scattered".

Grammar:
In Greek, εσπειρα is a feminine noun in the singular form. It belongs to the second declension, which means that its ending changes depending on its function in a sentence. For example, in the nominative case (subject of a sentence), it is εσπειρα, but in the accusative case (direct object of a sentence), it is εσπειραν.

Description:
εσπειρα can refer to a variety of things that have been sown or scattered, such as seeds, crops, or even ideas. It can also be used metaphorically to describe something that has been spread or disseminated widely.
