Word: εστηρικται

Etymology: The word εστηρικται comes from the Greek verb στηρίζω (stirízo), which means "to support" or "to stabilize". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate a passive voice, meaning that the action is being done to the subject of the sentence rather than the subject doing the action.

Grammar: εστηρικται is a third-person singular passive form of the verb στηρίζω (stirízo). It is in the present tense and indicative mood. The verb stem is στηρικτ-, and the suffix -αι (-ai) indicates that the subject is third-person singular.

Description: εστηρικται is a Greek verb that means "is being supported" or "is being stabilized". It is often used in the context of physical objects or structures that need support or stabilization.
