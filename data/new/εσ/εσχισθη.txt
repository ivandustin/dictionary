Word: εσχισθη

Etymology:
The word εσχισθη is a Greek verb that comes from the root word σχίζω (schizo), which means "to split" or "to divide". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a past tense form, so εσχισθη means "was split" or "was divided".

Grammar:
εσχισθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb σχίζω (schizo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an implied "it") is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
εσχισθη is a word that describes a past event in which something was split or divided. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine what specifically was split or divided. However, the word could be used in a variety of contexts, such as describing a crack in a wall, a separation between two groups of people, or a rift in a relationship.
