Word: εσιωπων

Etymology:
The word εσιωπων is derived from the Greek verb σιωπάω (siopao), which means "to be silent" or "to keep quiet". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate a negative form, so εσιωπων (esiopon) means "not being silent" or "not keeping quiet".

Grammar:
εσιωπων is a present participle in the masculine singular form. It is formed by adding the suffix -ων (-on) to the present stem of the verb σιωπάω (siopao). The present stem is σιωπ-, so the present participle is εσιωπων.

Description:
εσιωπων describes someone who is not silent or not keeping quiet. It can be used to describe someone who is speaking out or making noise, or someone who is not keeping a secret. It can also be used figuratively to describe someone who is not being discreet or who is not keeping a low profile.
