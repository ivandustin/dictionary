The word "εσφαγμένου" (esfagmenou) is a Greek adjective in the genitive case, which means "slaughtered" or "sacrificed". It comes from the verb "σφάζω" (sfazo), which means "to slaughter" or "to sacrifice". In Greek Orthodox Christianity, the word is often used to refer to the slaughter of the Holy Innocents by King Herod, which is commemorated on December 29th. In modern Greek, the word is also used to describe meat that has been slaughtered according to Islamic halal or Jewish kosher dietary laws.
