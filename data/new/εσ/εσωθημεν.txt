Word: εσωθημεν

Etymology:
The word εσωθημεν is a Greek word that comes from the verb σῴζω (sózo), which means "to save" or "to rescue". The word is in the perfect passive participle form, which means that the action of being saved or rescued has already been completed.

Grammar:
εσωθημεν is a third-person plural verb form in the perfect passive voice. It is a compound verb form, consisting of the prefix ε- (e-) and the verb σῴζω (sózo). The perfect tense indicates that the action of being saved or rescued has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the implied "we") received the action of being saved or rescued, rather than performing the action themselves.

Description:
εσωθημεν can be translated as "we have been saved" or "we have been rescued". The word is often used in a religious context, particularly in Christianity, to refer to the salvation of believers through faith in Jesus Christ. In this context, the word emphasizes that salvation is a gift that is received through faith, rather than something that can be earned through good works or personal merit. The word can also be used more generally to refer to being saved or rescued from danger or harm.
