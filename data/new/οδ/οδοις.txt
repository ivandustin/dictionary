The word "οδοις" (odois) is a Greek noun in the dative plural form, which means "roads" or "ways". It is derived from the Greek word "οδός" (odos), which also means "road" or "way". In Greek grammar, it is classified as a second declension noun, which means that its endings change depending on its grammatical function in a sentence. 

Etymologically, the word "οδός" is believed to have originated from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁ódeh₂-, which means "to travel" or "to go". This root is also the source of other related words in different languages, such as the English word "ode" (meaning "a poem meant to be sung") and the Latin word "iter" (meaning "journey" or "route").

In terms of its usage, the word "οδοις" can refer to physical roads or paths, as well as metaphorical ones, such as a path of life or a course of action. It can also be used in a figurative sense to describe a way of thinking or a particular approach to a problem.
