Description: Teeth are hard, calcified structures that are found in the jaws of many vertebrates. They are used for biting, chewing, and grinding food. Humans have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. The primary teeth start to erupt at around 6 months of age and are replaced by permanent teeth between the ages of 6 and 12. There are four types of teeth in humans: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Each type of tooth has a specific function in the chewing process. Dental hygiene is important for maintaining healthy teeth and preventing tooth decay and gum disease.
