Word: ετελεσθη

Etymology:
The word ετελεσθη is a Greek verb that comes from the root word τελέω (teleo), which means "to complete" or "to finish." The prefix ε- (e-) indicates that the action is in the past tense, so ετελεσθη means "it was completed" or "it was finished."

Grammar:
ετελεσθη is a third-person singular verb in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. It is also in the passive voice, which means that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action rather than the doer. In other words, ετελεσθη describes something that was done to the subject rather than something that the subject did.

Description:
ετελεσθη is a word that describes the completion of an action in the past. It can be used to indicate that something was finished or accomplished, or that a process was completed. The passive voice of the verb suggests that the subject was not the one who completed the action, but rather that it was done to them by someone or something else. Overall, ετελεσθη is a useful word for describing past events that have been brought to a conclusion.
