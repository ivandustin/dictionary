Word: ετοιμον

Etymology: The word ετοιμον comes from the Greek word "ετοιμος" (etoimos), which means "ready" or "prepared". The suffix "-ν" is added to the end of the word to indicate the neuter gender.

Grammar: ετοιμον is a neuter singular adjective in the nominative case. In Greek, adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, if ετοιμον were used to modify a feminine noun, it would become ετοιμη, and if it were used to modify a plural noun, it would become ετοιμα.

Description: ετοιμον is an adjective that describes something as being ready or prepared. It can be used to describe a wide range of things, from physical objects to people's mental states. For example, one might say "το φαγητό είναι ετοιμον" (to fagito einai etoimon), which means "the food is ready", or "είμαι ετοιμον για την εξέταση" (eimai etoimon gia tin exetasi), which means "I am ready for the exam".
