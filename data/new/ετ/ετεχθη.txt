Word: ετεχθη

Etymology: ετεχθη is a Greek word that comes from the verb τίκτω (tikto), which means "to give birth" or "to be born". It is in the aorist passive tense, which indicates that the action of being born has already taken place.

Grammar: ετεχθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb τίκτω (tikto). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the person who was born) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description: ετεχθη means "was born" in Greek. It is a simple past tense form that describes the act of being born. It can be used to talk about the birth of a person, an animal, or even an idea or a movement. In Greek mythology, many gods and heroes are said to have been "born" in various ways, and the word ετεχθη is often used to describe these births.
