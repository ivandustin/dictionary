Word: ρηθεις

Etymology:
The word ρηθεις is derived from the Greek verb "ρέω" (reo), which means "to flow" or "to stream". The verb is conjugated in the aorist tense, which indicates a completed action in the past.

Grammar:
ρηθεις is a verb in the aorist tense, third person singular, passive voice. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon. In this case, the subject is not specified, but it is implied that someone or something was spoken about or mentioned.

Description:
The word ρηθεις can be translated to mean "was said" or "was spoken". It is often used in Greek literature and mythology to introduce a statement or a piece of information that has been passed down through oral tradition. For example, in Homer's Odyssey, the phrase "ρηθεις δ' αρα ταυτα" (rētheis d' ara tauta) is used to introduce a story that has been told by someone else. In modern Greek, the word ρηθεις is still used to mean "was said" or "was spoken", but it is also used more broadly to mean "was mentioned" or "was discussed".
