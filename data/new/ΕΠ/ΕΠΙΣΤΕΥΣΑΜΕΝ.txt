The word "επιστευσαμεν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, first person plural form. It comes from the root word "πιστεύω" (pistevo), which means "to believe" in Greek. The prefix "επι-" (epi-) in this case adds the meaning of "upon" or "to" to the verb. The suffix "-σαμεν" (-samen) indicates the past tense and the first person plural form. Therefore, "επιστευσαμεν" translates to "we believed" in English.
