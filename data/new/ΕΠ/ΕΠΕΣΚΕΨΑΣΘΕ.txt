The word "επεσκέψασθε" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, second person plural form. It is derived from the verb "επισκέπτομαι" (episkeptomai), which means "to visit" or "to inspect". The prefix "επι-" (epi-) adds the meaning of "upon" or "over", while the root "σκεπτομαι" (skeptomai) means "to look" or "to consider". Therefore, "επεσκέψασθε" can be translated as "you visited" or "you inspected".
