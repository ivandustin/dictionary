The word "επικαλεσαμενου" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, middle voice, participle form. It comes from the verb "επικαλέομαι" (epikaleomai), which means "to call upon" or "to invoke." The word is formed by adding the prefix "επι-" (epi-), which denotes "upon" or "over," to the verb "καλέω" (kaleo), meaning "to call." The suffix "-σαμεν-" (-samen-) indicates the aorist tense, and the ending "-ου" (-ou) indicates the middle voice. In grammar, the aorist tense is used to express a past action without specifying its duration or completion, while the middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action upon itself.
