Etymology: The word "εποιούντο" comes from the Greek verb "ποιέω" (poiéo), which means "to do" or "to make." The prefix "επ-" (ep-) is added to the verb to indicate the past tense, resulting in "εποιούντο" (epoiónto), which means "they were doing" or "they were making."

Grammar: "Εποιούντο" is the third person plural, past tense, middle voice form of the verb "ποιέω" (poiéo). In Greek grammar, the middle voice is used to indicate that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. The past tense indicates that the action took place in the past.

Description: "Εποιούντο" is a verb form used in Greek to describe an action that was being done or made by a group of people in the past. It can be translated as "they were doing" or "they were making" in English.
