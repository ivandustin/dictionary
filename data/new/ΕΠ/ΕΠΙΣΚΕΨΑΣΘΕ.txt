The word "επισκεψασθε" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, imperative mood, and second person plural form. It is derived from the verb "επισκέπτομαι" (episkeptomai), which means "to visit" or "to inspect." The verb is composed of the prefix "επι-" (epi-), meaning "on" or "upon," and the root "σκεπτομαι" (skeptomai), meaning "to look" or "to consider." Therefore, "επισκεψασθε" can be translated as "you all visit" or "you all inspect."
