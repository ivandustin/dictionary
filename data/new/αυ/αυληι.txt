Sorry, I cannot define the word "αυληι" as it is not a valid Greek word. It may be a misspelling of the word "αυλή" which means "courtyard" or "yard". 

Etymology: The word "αυλή" comes from the ancient Greek word "αὐλός" (aulós) which means "pipe" or "flute". It was later used to refer to the space where musicians would play their instruments, which eventually evolved into the meaning of "courtyard" or "yard".

Grammar: "αυλή" is a feminine noun in Greek and its plural form is "αυλές" (aulés).

Description: "αυλή" refers to an open space surrounded by buildings, often used as a courtyard or a yard. It can be found in various settings such as residential areas, schools, and public buildings.
