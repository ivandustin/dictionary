I'm sorry, but the word "φωνηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It is possible that it is a misspelling of the word "φωνή" (phonē), which means "voice" or "sound". 

Etymology: The word "φωνή" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *bʰeh₂- ("to speak, say") and is related to the English word "phone".

Grammar: "Φωνή" is a feminine noun in Greek and its plural form is "φωνές" (phonés).

Description: "Φωνή" can refer to the sound produced by a person or animal, as well as to the ability to speak or make sounds. It can also refer to a person's voice or tone. In music, it can refer to a particular vocal or instrumental sound.
