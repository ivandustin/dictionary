Word: φωνήσας

Etymology:
The word φωνήσας comes from the Greek verb φωνέω (phonéo), which means "to make a sound, to speak, to call out". The suffix -σας (-sas) is the aorist participle form of the verb, indicating that the action of speaking has been completed in the past.

Grammar:
φωνήσας is a verb in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. It is also a participle, which means it can function as an adjective or a noun in a sentence. In this case, it is used as an adjective modifying a noun or pronoun that comes after it.

Description:
φωνήσας can be translated as "having spoken" or "after speaking". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the actions of Jesus or other characters in the stories. For example, in Mark 1:11, after Jesus is baptized, a voice from heaven says, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The Greek text reads, "καὶ φωνὴ ἐγένετο ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν· σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός, ἐν σοὶ εὐδόκησα." The word φωνὴ (phoné) means "voice" or "sound", and ἐγένετο (egeneto) is the aorist form of γίνομαι (ginomai), which means "to become" or "to happen". So, the phrase φωνὴ ἐγένετο means "a voice happened", or more idiomatically, "a voice came". The participle φωνήσας is used to describe the action of the voice, which is to say, it spoke the words "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
