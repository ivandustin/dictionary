Word: φωνηθηναι

Etymology: φωνηθηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word φωνή (phoné), which means "voice" or "sound". The suffix -θηναι (-thenai) is a passive aorist form, indicating that the action of the verb was done to the subject.

Grammar: φωνηθηναι is a passive aorist form of the Greek verb φωνέω (phonéo), which means "to sound" or "to speak". The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is receiving the action, rather than performing it. The aorist tense indicates that the action of the verb was completed in the past, without specifying the duration or repetition of the action.

Description: φωνηθηναι can be translated as "to be called" or "to be named" in English. It is often used in Greek mythology to describe the naming of a person or place. For example, in the myth of Perseus, the hero's mother Danae is said to have named him Perseus after he was born. In everyday Greek, φωνηθηναι can also be used to describe the act of being called or summoned, as in "I was called to the principal's office".
