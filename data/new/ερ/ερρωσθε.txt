Word: ερρωσθε

Etymology: ερρωσθε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word ρωννυμι (rōnnymi), which means "to strengthen" or "to make strong." The prefix ε- (e-) is added to indicate the perfect tense, which means the action has been completed in the past.

Grammar: ερρωσθε is a second person plural form of the aorist passive imperative tense in Greek. This means that it is a command directed towards a group of people, and the action is in the past and was done to the subject. The verb is passive, which means that the subject received the action rather than performed it.

It is often used as a form of encouragement or support, and can be translated as "take heart" or "be of good courage." The verb is commonly found in the New Testament of the Bible, where it is used to encourage believers to remain steadfast in their faith.
