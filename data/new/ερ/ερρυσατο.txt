Word: ερρυσατο

Etymology:
The word ερρυσατο is a conjugated form of the Greek verb ρύομαι (ryomai), which means "to rescue" or "to save". The verb ρύομαι comes from the ancient Greek root word ρύω (ryo), which means "to draw" or "to pull". 

Grammar:
ερρυσατο is the third person singular aorist middle/passive indicative form of the verb ρύομαι. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. 

Description:
ερρυσατο can be translated as "he/she/it was rescued" or "he/she/it saved himself/herself/itself". The middle/passive voice of the verb ρύομαι suggests that the subject was both the one who performed the action and the one who benefited from it. The word ερρυσατο implies that the action of rescuing or saving has already taken place in the past.
