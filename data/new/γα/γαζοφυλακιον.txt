Word: γαζοφυλάκιον

Etymology: The word γαζοφυλάκιον comes from the Greek words γάζα (gaza) meaning "treasury" and φυλακή (phylakí) meaning "prison". Therefore, γαζοφυλάκιον literally means "treasury prison".

Grammar: γαζοφυλάκιον is a neuter noun in Greek. Its plural form is γαζοφυλάκια (gazofylákia).

Description: γαζοφυλάκιον was a type of prison used in ancient Greece to hold people who were accused of embezzlement or theft from the state treasury. These prisons were often located near the treasury itself, and were used to hold prisoners until their trial. The conditions in γαζοφυλάκια were often harsh, and prisoners were sometimes subjected to torture in order to extract confessions. The use of γαζοφυλάκια declined in the Byzantine era, and they were eventually replaced by other types of prisons.
