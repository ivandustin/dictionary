Word: λελυμένον

Etymology:
λελυμένον is a Greek word that comes from the verb λύω (lyo), which means "to loosen" or "to untie". The word is in the perfect passive participle form, which means that the action of loosening or untying has been completed in the past and the subject is now in a state of being loosened or untied.

Grammar:
λελυμένον is a neuter gender noun in the singular form. It is in the nominative case, which means that it is the subject of the sentence. The word is also in the perfect tense, which indicates that the action of loosening or untying has been completed in the past and the subject is now in a state of being loosened or untied. The word is also in the passive voice, which means that the subject is receiving the action of the verb rather than performing it.

Description:
λελυμένον can be translated to English as "loosened" or "untied". It describes something that was previously tied or bound, but has now been released or freed. The word can be used in a literal sense, such as untying a knot, or in a figurative sense, such as being released from a burden or obligation.
