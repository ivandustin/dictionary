Description:
λεπράς is a Greek word that refers to a person who has leprosy or a skin disease that causes scaling and peeling of the skin. In ancient times, leprosy was considered a highly contagious and incurable disease, and those who were afflicted with it were often ostracized from society. Today, leprosy is treatable with antibiotics, and the stigma associated with the disease has largely disappeared. The word λεπράς is still used in modern Greek to refer to someone who has a skin disease, although it is not commonly used in everyday conversation.
