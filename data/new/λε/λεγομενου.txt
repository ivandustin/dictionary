Grammar: λεγομενου is a masculine singular genitive form of the present participle of the verb λέγω (lego). In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the stem of the verb. The present participle is used to describe an ongoing action or state.

For example, in Plato's Republic, Socrates uses the phrase "τοῦ λεγομένου" (tou legomenou) to refer to the concept of justice that is being discussed.
