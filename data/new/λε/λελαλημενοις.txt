Word: λελαλημένοις

Etymology:
The word λελαλημένοις is a Greek verb in the perfect passive participle form. It is derived from the verb λαλέω (laleo), which means "to speak" or "to talk". The prefix λε- (le-) indicates the perfect tense, while the suffix -μένοις (-menois) indicates the passive voice.

Grammar:
In Greek grammar, the perfect tense is used to describe an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon, rather than performing the action. Therefore, λελαλημένοις can be translated as "having been spoken to" or "having been talked to".
