λευκας (leukas) is a Greek adjective that means "white" or "bright". It is derived from the Greek word "λευκός" (leukos), which also means "white". In terms of grammar, λευκας is in the masculine singular nominative case. It can also be declined to match the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. For example, if it modifies a feminine singular noun, it would become "λευκή" (leuki).
