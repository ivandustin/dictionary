Word: λεπροί

Etymology: The word λεπροί (leproi) is derived from the Greek word λέπρα (lepra), which means "leprosy". In ancient Greece, leprosy was a feared and stigmatized disease, and those who suffered from it were often ostracized from society.

Grammar: λεπροί is a plural noun in the masculine gender. It is declined in the third declension, and its nominative singular form is λεπρός (lepros).

Description: λεπροί refers to people who suffer from leprosy. In ancient Greece, leprosy was a highly contagious and incurable disease that caused disfiguring skin lesions, nerve damage, and other serious health problems. Those who were afflicted with leprosy were often forced to live in isolation from the rest of society, and were considered to be unclean and impure. Despite advances in medical treatment, leprosy remains a serious health concern in many parts of the world today.
