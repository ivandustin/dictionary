The word "γεμισθηι" (gemisthēi) is a Greek verb in the aorist passive tense, which means it describes an action that was completed in the past and was done to the subject of the sentence. 

Etymology: The word comes from the root "γεμ-" (gem-), which means "to fill". The suffix "-ισθηι" (-isthēi) is a passive ending that indicates the subject received the action of the verb.

Grammar: "γεμισθηι" is a third-person singular verb, meaning it refers to a single subject. It is in the aorist tense, which is used to describe a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the subject received the action of the verb rather than performing it themselves.
