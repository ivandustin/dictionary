Description:
The word γενησεσθε is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in John 3:7, where Jesus tells Nicodemus, "You must be born again" (γεννηθῆναι ἄνωθεν, gennēthēnai anōthen). The verb γενησεσθε emphasizes the idea of a new birth or a new beginning, indicating a change in one's spiritual state. It is often used in Christian theology to describe the concept of being born again or being saved.
