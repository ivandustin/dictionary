Word: γενηθηναι

Etymology: γενηθηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γίγνομαι (gígnomai), which means "to become" or "to be born." The -θηναι (-thenai) ending is a passive aorist tense, indicating that the action of becoming or being born has already taken place.

Grammar: γενηθηναι is a third-person singular passive aorist form of the verb γίγνομαι. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is receiving the action, rather than performing it.

Description: γενηθηναι can be translated as "was born" or "was created." It is often used in reference to the birth or creation of a person or thing. In Greek mythology, for example, the goddess Athena is said to have been born fully grown and armored from the head of her father Zeus, using the verb γενηθηναι to describe her birth. The verb can also be used in a more general sense to describe the origin or beginning of something.
