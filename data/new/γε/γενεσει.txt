The word "γενεσει" (genēsei) is a Greek noun that means "origin" or "birth." It is derived from the Greek verb "γίγνομαι" (gignomai), which means "to be born" or "to come into existence." In terms of grammar, "γενεσει" is in the dative case, which is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb or the object of certain prepositions. 

In the context of the Bible, "γενεσει" is often used in reference to the genealogy or lineage of individuals, particularly in the book of Matthew where it appears in the phrase "τὸ βιβλίον τῆς γενέσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ υἱοῦ Δαυὶδ υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ" (to biblion tēs genēseōs Iēsou Christou huiou Dauid huiou Abraam), which translates to "the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
