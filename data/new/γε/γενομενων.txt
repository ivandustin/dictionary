Word: γενομενων

Etymology: 
The word γενομενων is the present participle of the Greek verb γίγνομαι (gígnomai), which means "to become" or "to be born". The verb is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *ǵenh₁- which means "to give birth" or "to produce".

Grammar:
γενομενων is a present participle in the genitive case, masculine gender, and plural number. In Greek, present participles are formed by adding the suffix -οντ- (-ont-) to the stem of the verb. The genitive case is used to indicate possession or relationship, and the masculine gender is used to refer to male nouns. The plural number is used to refer to more than one noun.

Description:
γενομενων can be translated as "of those who are becoming" or "of those who are being born". It is often used in the New Testament to refer to the descendants of a particular person or group, such as the "sons of Israel" or the "sons of Abraham". The word emphasizes the ongoing process of becoming or being born, rather than a static state of existence.
