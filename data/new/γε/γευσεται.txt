Word: γευσεται

Etymology: γευσεται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γεύομαι (geúomai), which means "to taste" or "to experience." 

Grammar: γευσεται is a present tense, third person singular form of the verb γεύομαι. It is in the middle voice, which means that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. 

Description: γευσεται means "he/she/it tastes" or "he/she/it experiences" in Greek. It is often used in the context of food or drink, but can also be used more broadly to describe any kind of experience. The middle voice emphasizes the subject's personal involvement in the action, suggesting that the experience is not just passive, but actively engaged with.
