Grammar: γεγεννηται is a third person singular verb in the perfect tense. It is in the indicative mood, which means it is a statement of fact. The verb is passive, which means the subject (the one who has been born) is receiving the action of the verb.

Description: γεγεννηται is a word that describes the state of having been born or having been begotten.

The word can also be used more generally to describe the birth of any person or animal.
