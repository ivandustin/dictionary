Word: γεγεννημένος

Etymology: The word γεγεννημένος comes from the Greek verb γεννάω (gennáo), which means "to beget" or "to give birth". The prefix γε- (ge-) indicates completion or perfect tense, so γεγεννημένος means "having been born" or "having been begotten".

Grammar: γεγεννημένος is a past participle in Greek, which means it is used to describe an action that has already been completed. It is often used in passive constructions, where the subject receives the action of the verb. For example, in the sentence "Ο Ιησούς Χριστός είναι ο γεγεννημένος υιός του Θεού" (Jesus Christ is the begotten son of God), γεγεννημένος describes the state of being born or begotten, and is used to describe Jesus as the son of God.
