Word: γεννηθεις

Etymology:
The word γεννηθεις is derived from the Greek verb γεννάω (gennáo), which means "to beget" or "to give birth." The suffix -θεις (-theis) is a past participle ending, indicating that the word is in the past tense and passive voice. Therefore, γεννηθεις means "having been born" or "having been begotten."

Grammar:
γεννηθεις is a past participle in the Greek language, which means it functions as an adjective. It agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun, it would be γεννηθείς (gennethis), and if it modifies a feminine singular noun, it would be γεννηθεῖσα (gennethisa). In this form, it is declined like a first-declension noun.

Description:
γεννηθεις is a word that describes someone or something that has been born or begotten. It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the birth of Jesus Christ, as in Matthew 1:18: "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost." The word emphasizes the idea of being brought into existence, and it can also connote a sense of newness or freshness.
