Word: γεγεννημένου

Etymology:
The word γεγεννημένου is a Greek word that comes from the verb γεννάω (gennao), which means "to beget" or "to give birth." The prefix γε- (ge-) is an intensifier, so γεγεννημένου can be translated as "born" or "begotten."

Grammar:
γεγεννημένου is the genitive singular form of the past participle of the verb γεννάω. In Greek, the genitive case is used to show possession or relationship, and the singular form indicates that the word is referring to one person or thing.

Description:
γεγεννημένου is a word that describes someone who has been born or begotten. It is often used in religious contexts to refer to Jesus Christ, who is described as the "only begotten Son" of God in the New Testament. The word can also be used more generally to describe anyone who has been born or brought into existence.
