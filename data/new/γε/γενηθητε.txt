Word: γενηθητε

Etymology:
The word γενηθητε is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γίνομαι (ginomai), which means "to become" or "to be born." The verb form γενηθητε (genēthēte) is the second person plural aorist passive imperative form of γίνομαι.

Grammar:
In Greek grammar, γενηθητε is a second person plural aorist passive imperative verb form. This means that it is a command directed at a group of people (you all) to perform a specific action in the past (aorist tense) and in the passive voice (the subject receives the action rather than performing it).

Description:
The word γενηθητε is used in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the book of Matthew (chapter 5, verse 48) and in the book of James (chapter 1, verse 4). In both instances, it is used as a command to be perfect or complete in one's actions or character. The full phrase in Matthew is "Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect," and in James it is "Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."
