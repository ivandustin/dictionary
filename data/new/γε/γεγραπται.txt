Word: γεγραπται

Etymology:
The word γεγραπται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γράφω (grapho), which means "to write." The prefix γε- (ge-) is a perfect tense marker, indicating that the action of writing has been completed in the past.

Grammar:
γεγραπται is a third-person singular perfect passive indicative form of the verb γράφω. In Greek, the perfect tense is used to describe an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
γεγραπται can be translated to mean "it has been written" or "it is written." This verb form is commonly used in the New Testament of the Bible to refer to passages that have been written in scripture. For example, in Matthew 4:4, Jesus responds to Satan's temptation by saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'" The use of the perfect tense emphasizes the ongoing relevance and authority of the written word.
