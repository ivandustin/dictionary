Word: γεγεννημαι

Etymology:
The word γεγεννημαι comes from the Greek verb γεννάω (gennáo), which means "to beget" or "to give birth". The prefix γε- (ge-) is an intensifier, so γεγεννημαι (gegennēmai) means "to be born" or "to be begotten".

Grammar:
γεγεννημαι is a Greek verb in the perfect tense, which indicates a completed action in the past with ongoing effects in the present. It is also in the passive voice, which means that the subject of the verb (in this case, the person who was born) is not the one performing the action, but rather is receiving the action.

Description:
γεγεννημαι is a word that describes the act of being born or begotten. It is often used in a religious context to refer to the birth of Jesus Christ, as it appears in the New Testament of the Bible. The word can also be used more generally to describe the act of being born or coming into existence.
