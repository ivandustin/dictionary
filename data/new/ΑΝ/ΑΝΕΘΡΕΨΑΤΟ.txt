Etymology: The word "ανεθρεψατο" comes from the Greek language. It is a compound word formed by the prefix "αν-" (meaning "not") and the verb "εθρεψατο" (meaning "to nourish" or "to raise"). 

Grammar: "ανεθρεψατο" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the verb "εθρεψατο" (aorist tense of "θρεπτω"), which means "to nourish" or "to raise". The prefix "αν-" negates the action of the verb, so "ανεθρεψατο" can be translated as "he/she/it did not nourish" or "he/she/it did not raise".

Description: "ανεθρεψατο" is a Greek word that describes the action of not nourishing or not raising someone or something. It can be used in various contexts, such as describing a person who failed to provide care or support, or a situation where something was not properly nurtured or developed.
