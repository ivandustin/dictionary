Etymology: The word "αναζωσαμενοι" comes from the Greek verb "αναζωννύω" (anazōnnýō), which means "to gird up" or "to equip oneself." It is derived from the prefix "ανα-" (ana-), meaning "up" or "again," and the verb "ζώννυμι" (zōnnymi), meaning "to gird" or "to fasten."

Grammar: "Αναζωσαμενοι" is the plural form of the verb "αναζωσάμενος" (anazōsámenos), which is the aorist middle participle of "αναζωννύω." In Greek grammar, participles are verb forms that can function as adjectives or nouns. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the middle voice suggests that the subject is performing the action on themselves.

Description: "Αναζωσαμενοι" can be translated as "having girded up" or "having equipped themselves." It describes a group of people who have prepared themselves or made themselves ready for something. The exact meaning and context of the word would depend on the specific sentence or passage in which it is used.
