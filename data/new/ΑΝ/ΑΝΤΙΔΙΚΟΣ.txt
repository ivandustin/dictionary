The word "αντιδικος" (antidikos) is a Greek word that can be broken down into two parts: "αντι" (anti) meaning "against" or "opposite" and "δικος" (dikos) meaning "related to justice" or "legal". 

In terms of etymology, "αντιδικος" comes from the combination of the prefix "αντι" and the noun "δικος". The prefix "αντι" indicates opposition or contrast, while "δικος" refers to matters of justice or law. Therefore, "αντιδικος" can be understood as someone who is against or opposed to matters of justice or law.

In grammar, "αντιδικος" is a masculine noun in the nominative case. It can also be declined in other cases, such as genitive (αντιδικου), dative (αντιδικω), accusative (αντιδικο), and vocative (αντιδικε).

In terms of description, "αντιδικος" can refer to someone who is an adversary, opponent, or antagonist in a legal or judicial context. It can also be used more broadly to describe someone who is against or opposed to something in a general sense.
