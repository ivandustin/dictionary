Etymology: The word "ανεκραγον" (anekragon) comes from the Greek roots "αν" (an), meaning "not," and "εκραγον" (ekragon), meaning "to explode." 

Grammar: "Ανεκραγον" is a verb in the past tense, third person singular form. It is derived from the verb "εκραγον" (ekragon), which means "to explode." The prefix "αν" (an) negates the action, so "ανεκραγον" means "did not explode."

Description: "Ανεκραγον" is used to describe an action that did not result in an explosion. It can be used in various contexts, such as describing a failed attempt at causing an explosion or indicating that something remained intact without exploding.
