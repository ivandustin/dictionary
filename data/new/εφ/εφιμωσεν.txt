Word: εφιμωσεν

Etymology: The word εφιμωσεν comes from the Greek verb εφιμώνω (efimono), which means "to muzzle" or "to silence". It is derived from the prefix ε- (e-), which means "out" or "away", and the verb φιμόω (fimo-o), which means "to muzzle" or "to silence".

In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing the action.
