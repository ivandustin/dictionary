Word: εφυσιωθησαν

Etymology: The word εφυσιωθησαν is derived from the Greek verb φυσιόω (physiόo), which means "to inflate" or "to swell". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a change of state or action, so εφυσιωθησαν can be translated as "they were inflated" or "they swelled up".

Grammar: εφυσιωθησαν is a third-person plural passive aorist form of the verb φυσιόω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, an unspecified group of people or things) received the action rather than performing it themselves.

Description: εφυσιωθησαν can be translated as "they were inflated" or "they swelled up". The context in which the word is used will determine the exact meaning. It could refer to a physical swelling, such as a balloon or a person's body part, or it could be used metaphorically to describe a situation or emotion that has become exaggerated or overblown.
