Word: εφυτευσεν

Etymology: The word εφυτευσεν comes from the Greek verb φυτεύω (phytevo), which means "to plant" or "to sow". The prefix ε- (e-) is a common Greek prefix that can indicate "out" or "away from", so εφυτευσεν can be translated as "he/she/it planted out" or "he/she/it sowed away from".

Grammar: εφυτευσεν is the third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb φυτεύω (phytevo). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a completed action in the past, without indicating the duration or repetition of the action. The active voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (he/she/it) performed the action of planting or sowing.

Description: εφυτευσεν is a Greek verb that means "he/she/it planted" or "he/she/it sowed". It is a past tense form, indicating that the action of planting or sowing has already been completed. The word can be used in a literal sense, to describe the act of planting or sowing seeds in the ground, or in a figurative sense, to describe the act of establishing or introducing something new.
