Word: δεδεκατωται

Etymology:
The word δεδεκατωται is derived from the Greek word δέκα (deka) which means "ten". The prefix δεδεκα- (dedeka-) means "twelve times" or "twelfth". The suffix -ται (-tai) is a third person plural ending, indicating that the word is in the passive voice.

Grammar:
δεδεκατωται is a verb in the perfect passive indicative form. The perfect tense indicates that the action has been completed in the past and has continuing relevance in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action.

Description:
δεδεκατωται means "they have been tithed" or "they have been taxed". The word is used in the New Testament of the Bible in reference to the practice of tithing, which was a requirement in Jewish law. The word is found in Luke 18:12, where a Pharisee boasts about tithing "all that he possesses".
