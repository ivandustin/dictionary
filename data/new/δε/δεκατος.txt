Etymology:
The word δεκατος (dekatos) is derived from the Greek word δέκα (deka) which means "ten". It is a combination of the prefix δεκα- (deka-) meaning "ten" and the suffix -τος (-tos) which is used to form adjectives.

Grammar:
In Greek, δεκατος is an adjective that agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. It can be declined in three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), and four cases (nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative).

Description:
The word δεκατος (dekatos) is used to describe something that is "tenth" or "of the tenth". It can be used to describe a fraction, a position in a sequence, or a division of something into ten parts. For example, in ancient Greece, the δεκάτη (dekate) was a tax of one-tenth of a person's income or produce. In modern Greek, δεκατος is also used to describe the decimal system, where each digit represents a power of ten.
