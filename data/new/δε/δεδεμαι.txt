Etymology:
The word δεδεμαι (dedemai) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word δέω (deo), which means "to bind" or "to tie." The prefix δε- (de-) is an intensive prefix that emphasizes the action of the verb. Therefore, δεδεμαι (dedemai) means "to bind tightly" or "to fasten securely."

Grammar:

The present perfect tense indicates that the action of the verb has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The middle/passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action. Therefore, δεδεμαι (dedemai) can be translated as "I have been bound" or "I have fastened myself securely."
