δεκαπολεως (dekapolis) is a Greek word that literally means "ten cities". It is a compound word formed from δέκα (deka), meaning "ten", and πόλις (polis), meaning "city". In ancient times, the term was used to refer to a group of ten cities in the eastern part of the Roman Empire, which were culturally and politically connected. These cities were located in modern-day Jordan, Syria, and Israel. The Decapolis was known for its Hellenistic culture and architecture, and was an important center of trade and commerce. In the New Testament, the Decapolis is mentioned as a region where Jesus performed several miracles.
