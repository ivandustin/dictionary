Word: δεδεκται

Etymology:
δεδεκται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word δέχομαι (dekhomai), which means "to receive" or "to accept." The prefix δε- (de-) indicates that the action is in the perfect tense, meaning that it has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Grammar:
δεδεκται is a third-person singular form of the verb δέχομαι (dekhomai) in the perfect tense. It is in the indicative mood, which indicates a statement of fact. The verb is passive, meaning that the subject receives the action of the verb rather than performing it.

Description:
δεδεκται means "has been accepted" or "has been received." It is often used in legal or formal contexts to indicate that something has been approved or acknowledged. The passive voice emphasizes that the subject has not actively done anything to bring about the acceptance or reception, but rather has simply been the recipient of it.
