Word: δεδικαιωται

Etymology:
The word δεδικαιωται comes from the Greek verb δικαιόω (dikaioo), which means "to justify" or "to declare righteous". The prefix δε- (de-) indicates that the action of justifying has already been completed, so δεδικαιωται (dedikaiotai) means "has been justified" or "has been declared righteous".

Grammar:
δεδικαιωται is a third-person singular perfect passive indicative form of the verb δικαιόω (dikaioo). In Greek, the perfect tense indicates a completed action with ongoing results, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon rather than performing the action. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
δεδικαιωται is a word used in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the letters of Paul. It is often translated as "justified" or "declared righteous" and refers to the idea that through faith in Jesus Christ, a person is made right with God and their sins are forgiven. The concept of justification by faith is a central theme in Paul's theology and has been a topic of much debate and discussion in Christian theology throughout history.
