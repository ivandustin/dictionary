The word "δευτερου" (deuteron) is a Greek adjective that means "second" or "next in order". It is derived from the Greek word "δεύτερος" (deuteros), which has the same meaning. 

In terms of grammar, "δευτερου" is in the genitive case, which is used to show possession or relationship between nouns. It can be used to modify a noun or to indicate the noun that is being modified. 

For example, in the phrase "το δεύτερο βιβλίο" (to deutero vivlio), which means "the second book", "δεύτερο" is in the nominative case and modifies the noun "βιβλίο" (vivlio), which means "book". If we want to say "the cover of the second book", we would use the genitive case and say "η εξώφυλλο του δευτέρου βιβλίου" (i exofyllo tou deuteron vivliou).

Overall, "δευτερου" is a useful word in Greek for indicating the second or next in order of something.
