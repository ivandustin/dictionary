The word δειλιατω (deiliatō) is a verb in the Greek language. Its etymology can be traced back to the root word δειλός (deilos), which means "cowardly" or "timid." 

In terms of grammar, δειλιατω is a present active imperative verb, which means it is a command or request given in the present tense. It is often translated as "let him be cowardly" or "let him act timidly."

The word δειλιατω is not commonly used in modern Greek, but it can be found in ancient Greek literature, particularly in the works of Homer and other epic poets. It is often used to describe characters who are hesitant or fearful in battle or other challenging situations.
