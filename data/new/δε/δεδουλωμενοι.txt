The word δεδουλωμένοι (dedoulomenoi) is a Greek verb in the perfect passive participle form. It comes from the root word δουλόω (douloo), which means "to enslave" or "to make someone a slave." The prefix δε- (de-) indicates that the action is completed and the participle ending -μένοι (-menoi) indicates that the subject is passive.

In English, δεδουλωμένοι can be translated as "enslaved," "made into slaves," or "having been enslaved." It is often used in the context of ancient Greek slavery, which was a common practice in the ancient world.
