Word: δεδεκως

Etymology: δεδεκως is a Greek adverb that is derived from the numeral δέκα (deka), meaning "ten". The prefix δε- (de-) is a reduplication that intensifies the meaning of the numeral, giving it the sense of "very tenfold" or "ten times over".

Grammar: δεδεκως is an adverb in Greek, which means that it modifies the meaning of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. It is formed by adding the suffix -ως (-ōs) to the reduplicated form of the numeral δέκα (deka). The adverb δεδεκως indicates a high degree or intensity of the action or quality it modifies, and can be translated as "very much", "greatly", or "exceedingly".

Description: δεδεκως is a rare and archaic word in Greek that is mostly found in ancient texts and poetry. It is used to express a strong emphasis or exaggeration, and is often associated with hyperbole and rhetorical figures. In the New Testament, δεδεκως appears only once, in the Gospel of Mark (10:30), where Jesus promises his disciples that they will receive "a hundredfold" (ἑκατονταπλασίονα, hekatontaplasiona) in the present age, along with persecutions, and in the age to come, eternal life. The use of δεδεκως here reinforces the idea of abundance and reward, but also of sacrifice and suffering.
