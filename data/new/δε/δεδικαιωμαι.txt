Word: δεδικαιωμαι

Etymology:
The word δεδικαιωμαι comes from the Greek root δικαιόω (dikaióō), which means "to justify" or "to declare righteous." The prefix δεδ- (ded-) indicates that the action of justifying has already been completed in the past.

Grammar:
δεδικαιωμαι is a first-person singular perfect passive indicative form of the verb δικαιόω (dikaióō). In Greek, the perfect tense indicates that an action was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "I") is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
δεδικαιωμαι can be translated as "I have been justified" or "I am justified." The word is often used in a theological context to refer to the idea of being declared righteous or forgiven by God. In this sense, it is related to the concept of salvation and the belief that one's sins can be forgiven through faith in Jesus Christ. The word can also be used more generally to refer to being vindicated or proven right in a particular situation.
