The word "δεδεμένα" (dedemena) is a Greek verb in the perfect tense, which means that the action it describes has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. 

Etymology: The word comes from the root "δεμ-" which means "to bind" or "to tie". The prefix "δε-" indicates completion of the action, so "δεδεμένα" means "bound" or "tied up".

Grammar: "Δεδεμένα" is the perfect participle of the verb "δένω" (deno), which means "to tie" or "to bind". It is used to describe something that has been tied up or bound in the past and remains in that state in the present.
