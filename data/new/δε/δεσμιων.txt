The word "δεσμιων" (desmion) is a Greek noun in the genitive plural form, which means "of prisoners" or "of captives". It is derived from the verb "δεσμεύω" (desmevo), which means "to bind" or "to tie up". In ancient Greece, prisoners of war or criminals were often bound with ropes or chains, hence the origin of the word. In modern Greek, "δεσμιων" is still used to refer to prisoners or captives. In terms of grammar, "δεσμιων" is a second declension noun, with a stem ending in "-ον" and a genitive plural ending in "-ων".
