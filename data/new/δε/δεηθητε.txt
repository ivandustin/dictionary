The word "δεηθητε" (deēthēte) is a verb in the Greek language. It is the second person plural, aorist tense, passive voice of the verb "δέομαι" (deomai), which means "to lack, need, want, desire, or pray for." 

Etymology: The word "δέομαι" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *deh₁- ("to lack, want"), which is also the source of the English words "dearth" and "deficient."

Grammar: As mentioned earlier, "δεηθητε" is the second person plural, aorist tense, passive voice of "δέομαι." The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. Therefore, "δεηθητε" can be translated as "you were prayed for" or "you were in need of."

Description: "δεηθητε" is a relatively uncommon word in Greek, and is mostly found in ancient texts. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context, where someone is praying for the needs of others. In modern Greek, the verb "δέομαι" is more commonly used in its active form, to express one's own needs or desires.
