Word: δεδοται

Etymology:
The word δεδοται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word δίδωμι (didomi), which means "to give." The prefix δε- (de-) is a perfect tense marker, indicating that the action of giving has been completed in the past.

Grammar:
δεδοται is a third-person singular perfect passive indicative form of the verb δίδωμι (didomi). In Greek, the perfect tense is used to describe an action that was completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer.

Description:
δεδοται can be translated as "has been given" or "was given." It is often used in the New Testament to describe gifts or blessings that have been given by God. For example, in James 1:17, it is written, "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change." The word δεδοται emphasizes the completed nature of the gift and the ongoing effects it has in the present.
