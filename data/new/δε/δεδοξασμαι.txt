Word: δεδοξασμαι

Etymology: δεδοξασμαι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word δόξα (doxa), which means "glory" or "honor". The prefix δε- (de-) indicates that the verb is in the perfect tense, which means that the action has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present.

Grammar: δεδοξασμαι is a first-person singular verb in the perfect tense. It is a passive form, which means that the subject (in this case, "I") is the recipient of the action rather than the doer. The verb is also middle voice, which indicates that the subject is both the doer and the recipient of the action.

Description: δεδοξασμαι can be translated as "I have been glorified" or "I have been honored". The verb implies that the subject has received glory or honor from someone else, rather than achieving it through their own efforts. In the context of Greek mythology, the verb could be used to describe a hero who has been elevated to the status of a god, or a mortal who has been granted immortality by the gods. In a religious context, the verb could be used to describe a person who has been sanctified or made holy by God.
