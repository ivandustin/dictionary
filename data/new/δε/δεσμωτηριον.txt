Description:
δεσμωτηριον refers to a place where prisoners are held in chains. In ancient Greece, prisoners were often held in underground dungeons or in small, cramped cells. The conditions in these prisons were often harsh, with little or no access to food, water, or sanitation. Prisoners were often subjected to torture and other forms of mistreatment. The word δεσμωτηριον is still used in modern Greek to refer to a prison or jail.
