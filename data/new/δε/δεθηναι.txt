Word: δεθηναι

Etymology:
δεθηναι is a Greek verb that comes from the root word δεσμός (desmos), which means "bond" or "tie." The verb form δεθηναι is the aorist passive infinitive of the verb δέω (deo), which means "to bind" or "to tie."

Grammar:
δεθηναι is a passive infinitive verb form in Greek. It is formed by adding the prefix δε- to the root verb δέω, and then adding the passive infinitive ending -θηναι. The verb form indicates that the action of binding or tying is being done to the subject of the sentence, rather than the subject doing the action.

Description:
δεθηναι is a verb that describes the act of being bound or tied. It is often used in a metaphorical sense to describe being bound by obligations, duties, or responsibilities. In Greek mythology, the god Prometheus was famously bound to a rock as punishment for stealing fire from the gods, and the verb δεθηναι is used to describe his binding. The verb can also be used in a more literal sense to describe the act of tying or binding objects together.
