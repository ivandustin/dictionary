Word: δεδαμασται

Etymology:
δεδαμασται is a Greek word that is derived from the verb δαμάζω (damazo), which means "to tame" or "to subdue". The prefix δε- (de-) is a perfect tense marker, indicating that the action of taming or subduing has been completed in the past.

Grammar:
δεδαμασται is a third-person singular perfect passive indicative form of the verb δαμάζω (damazo). The perfect tense indicates that the action of taming or subduing has been completed in the past and has ongoing effects in the present. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence (the thing being tamed or subdued) is the recipient of the action, rather than the doer of the action.

Description:
δεδαμασται can be translated as "has been tamed" or "has been subdued". It describes something that was once wild or unruly but has been brought under control. The word can be used in a literal sense, such as taming a wild animal, or in a figurative sense, such as taming one's emotions or desires.
