The word "ωφθην" (ophthēn) is a Greek verb that is in the aorist tense and passive voice. It is the first person singular form of the verb "ὁράω" (horaō), which means "to see" or "to perceive." The aorist tense indicates that the action of seeing occurred at a specific point in time, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, "I") received the action of the verb rather than performing it. Therefore, "ωφθην" can be translated as "I was seen" or "I appeared."
