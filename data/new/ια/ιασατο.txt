Word: ιασατο

Etymology: ιασατο is a form of the Greek verb ιάομαι (iaomai), which means "to heal" or "to cure". The verb is derived from the noun ιατρός (iatros), which means "physician" or "healer".

Grammar: ιασατο is a third-person singular aorist middle-passive indicative form of ιάομαι (iaomai). In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, while the middle-passive voice indicates that the subject is both the doer and the receiver of the action.

Description: ιασατο can be translated as "he/she/it was healed" or "he/she/it cured himself/herself/itself". The form indicates that the subject was healed or cured in the past, and that the action was performed by the subject on themselves. The word can be used in a medical context, but it can also be used metaphorically to describe emotional or spiritual healing.
