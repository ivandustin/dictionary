Etymology: ιαθητω is a Greek word that comes from the verb ιάομαι (iaomai), which means "to heal" or "to cure". 

Grammar: ιαθητω is a third person singular aorist passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the suffix -τω (-tō) to the stem ιαθη- (iathē-). The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject receives the action of the verb. The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests.
