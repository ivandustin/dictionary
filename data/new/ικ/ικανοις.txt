The word "ικανοις" (ikanis) is a Greek adjective in the dative plural form, meaning "capable" or "able". Its etymology can be traced back to the Greek word "ικανός" (ikanos), which has the same meaning. In terms of grammar, it is a third declension adjective, which means its form changes depending on the gender, number, and case of the noun it modifies. 

For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, it would be "ικανός" (ikanos), while if it modifies a feminine singular noun in the nominative case, it would be "ικανή" (ikani). In the dative plural form, as in "ικανοις" (ikanis), it would modify a plural noun and indicate that the noun is capable or able to do something. 

Overall, "ικανοις" is a versatile adjective that can be used in various contexts to describe the capabilities or abilities of a group of people or things.
