Word: ηυχομην

Etymology: ηυχομην is a Greek verb that comes from the root word εὔχομαι (eúkhomai), which means "to pray" or "to wish". The prefix η- (ē-) is a form of the verb εἰμί (eimí), which means "to be". Therefore, ηυχομην can be translated as "I was praying" or "I was wishing".

Grammar: ηυχομην is a first-person singular form of the aorist tense in the middle voice. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration. The middle voice indicates that the subject is performing the action on themselves or for their own benefit.
