Word: ηυλησαμεν

Etymology: ηυλησαμεν is a Greek verb that comes from the root word "υλη" (hyle), which means "matter" or "material." The prefix "ευ" (eu) means "good" or "well," so ηυλησαμεν can be translated as "to shape or form something well from matter."

Grammar: ηυλησαμεν is the first person plural aorist active indicative form of the verb ηυλεω (hyleo), which means "to shape or form from matter." The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, and the active voice means that the subject (we) performed the action.

Description: ηυλησαμεν can be translated as "we shaped or formed well from matter." It implies a deliberate and skilled act of creation or craftsmanship. The word can be used in a literal sense, such as shaping a sculpture or molding clay, or in a figurative sense, such as shaping one's character or destiny.
