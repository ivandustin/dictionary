Description: χαναναια is a term used in the New Testament to refer to a woman from the region of Canaan who came to Jesus to ask for healing for her daughter. The story is told in Matthew 15:21-28 and Mark 7:24-30. In both accounts, Jesus initially refuses to help her, saying that he was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel. However, the woman persists, saying that even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table. Jesus is impressed by her faith and grants her request, healing her daughter. The story is often interpreted as an example of Jesus' compassion and willingness to help even those outside of his own community.
