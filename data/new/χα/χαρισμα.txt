Word: χαρισμα

Etymology:
The word χαρισμα (charisma) comes from the Greek word χαρις (charis), which means "grace" or "favor." In ancient Greek, χαρις was used to describe a gift or favor given by a god or goddess. The suffix -μα (-ma) is a common Greek suffix that indicates the result or product of an action, so χαρισμα can be translated as "the result of grace" or "the product of favor."

Grammar:
χαρισμα is a neuter noun in Greek, and its plural form is χαρισματα (charismata). In English, it is often used as a singular noun, but it can also be used as a plural noun to refer to multiple gifts or talents.

Description:
χαρισμα is a term that is often used in Christian theology to refer to spiritual gifts or abilities that are given by God to believers. These gifts are seen as a manifestation of the Holy Spirit and are intended to be used for the benefit of the church and the world. Examples of χαρισματα include prophecy, healing, teaching, and speaking in tongues. However, the term can also be used more broadly to refer to any natural or acquired talent or ability that is seen as a gift from God or the universe.
