The word "χαλδαιων" (chaldaiōn) is a Greek term that refers to the Chaldeans, an ancient people who lived in the region of Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) from the 10th to the 6th century BCE. The etymology of the word is derived from the Akkadian word "kaldu," which means "Chaldean." 

In terms of grammar, "χαλδαιων" is a noun in the genitive case, which means it is used to indicate possession or relationship to another noun. For example, "the land of the Chaldeans" would be translated as "ἡ χωρα των χαλδαιων" (hē chōra tōn chaldaiōn) in Greek.

In description, the Chaldeans were known for their expertise in astronomy and astrology, as well as their contributions to the development of mathematics and the sciences. They also played a significant role in the history of the ancient Near East, particularly during the reign of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II.
