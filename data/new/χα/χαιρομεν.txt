Word: χαιρομεν

Etymology: χαιρομεν is a present participle form of the Greek verb χαίρω (khairō), which means "to rejoice" or "to be glad". The word comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *ǵʰer- ("to like, want").

Grammar: χαιρομεν is a present participle in the active voice, masculine gender, and plural number. It is formed by adding the suffix -μεν (-men) to the present stem χαιρ- (chair-). The present participle is used to describe an ongoing action or state that is happening at the same time as the main verb.

Description: χαιρομεν can be translated as "rejoicing" or "being glad". It is often used in the New Testament to describe the joy and happiness that comes from knowing God. For example, in Philippians 4:4, the apostle Paul writes, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice." The word can also be used in a more general sense to describe any kind of joy or happiness.
