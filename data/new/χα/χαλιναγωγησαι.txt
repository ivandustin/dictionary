Word: χαλιναγωγησαι

Etymology:
The word χαλιναγωγησαι is a Greek verb that comes from the combination of two words: χαλινός (halinós), meaning "bridle," and ἀγωγός (agogós), meaning "leader" or "guide." Therefore, the word χαλιναγωγησαι means "to lead by the bridle" or "to guide with a bridle."

Grammar:
χαλιναγωγησαι is a verb in the aorist tense, active voice, and infinitive mood. It is a compound verb, formed by combining the noun χαλινός (halinós) with the verb ἀγωγός (agogós) and adding the suffix -σαι (-sai) to indicate the infinitive mood.

Description:
χαλιναγωγησαι is a rare and complex word that is not commonly used in modern Greek. It is mostly found in ancient Greek texts, particularly in the New Testament, where it is used metaphorically to describe the act of guiding or controlling one's actions or behavior. The word implies a sense of restraint or discipline, as if the person being led is like a horse that needs to be guided and controlled by a bridle.
