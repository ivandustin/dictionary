The word "ευαγγέλιο" (evangelio) comes from the Greek words "ευ" (eu) meaning "good" and "αγγελία" (angelia) meaning "message" or "announcement". Therefore, the word means "good news" or "good message". 

In terms of grammar, "ευαγγέλιο" is a neuter noun in the singular form. 

In Christianity, "ευαγγέλιο" refers to the four books of the New Testament that tell the story of Jesus Christ and his teachings. These books are known as the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. 

Outside of Christianity, "ευαγγέλιο" can also refer to any message or news that is considered to be good or positive.
