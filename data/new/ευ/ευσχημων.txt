Word: ευσχημων

Etymology:
The word ευσχημων comes from the Greek roots ευ- (eu-), meaning "good" or "well," and σχημα (schēma), meaning "form" or "shape." Together, ευσχημων means "well-formed" or "well-shaped."

Grammar:
ευσχημων is an adjective in the masculine singular form. In Greek, adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. For example, if ευσχημων were used to describe a feminine noun, it would be written as ευσχημονα (euschēmona) in the feminine singular form.

Description:
ευσχημων is often used to describe physical appearance, particularly in reference to a person's good looks or attractive figure. It can also be used more broadly to describe anything that is well-formed or well-proportioned, such as a well-designed building or a well-crafted piece of art. In addition, ευσχημων can be used figuratively to describe someone who is well-behaved or socially graceful.
