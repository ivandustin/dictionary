The word ευοδωθησομαι is a compound word in Greek, consisting of two parts: ευ (eu) meaning "good" or "well" and οδω (odo) meaning "way" or "path". The suffix θησομαι (thesomai) is a future passive form of the verb τιθημι (tithemi) meaning "to place" or "to set". Therefore, the word ευοδωθησομαι can be translated as "to be well-placed" or "to be successful".
