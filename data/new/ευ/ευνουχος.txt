Word: ευνούχος

Etymology:
The word ευνούχος (eunouchos) comes from the Greek words εὖ (eu) meaning "well" and νοῦς (nous) meaning "mind". The word originally referred to a person who was in charge of the bedchamber of a royal court or a wealthy household. Over time, the meaning of the word evolved to refer to a castrated man who served in a similar role.

Grammar:
In Greek, ευνούχος is a masculine noun in the nominative case. Its plural form is ευνούχοι (eunouchoi). The word is declined like other second declension nouns, with the stem ευνουχ- (eunouch-).

Description:
The word ευνούχος refers to a man who has been castrated, typically for the purpose of serving in a royal court or wealthy household. In ancient times, eunuchs were often employed as guards, servants, or advisors to rulers. They were valued for their loyalty and discretion, as they were unable to father children and were therefore less likely to have personal ambitions that could conflict with those of their masters. Eunuchs were also sometimes used as harem guards, as they were considered less likely to be sexually interested in the women they were guarding. The practice of castration for the purpose of creating eunuchs has largely fallen out of use in modern times, although there are still some cultures where it is practiced.
