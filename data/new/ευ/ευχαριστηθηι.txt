I'm sorry, but the word "ευχαριστηθηι" does not exist in the Greek language. It appears to be a misspelling of the word "ευχαριστήθηκε" (efcharistithike), which is the past tense form of the verb "ευχαριστώ" (efcharisto) meaning "thank you" in English. 

Etymology: The word "ευχαριστώ" comes from the Greek words "ευ" (eu) meaning "good" and "χάρις" (charis) meaning "grace" or "favor". 

Grammar: "Ευχαριστώ" is a verb in the present tense, and "ευχαριστήθηκε" is the past tense form. It is a regular verb and follows the conjugation pattern of verbs ending in "-ω" in Greek.

Description: "Ευχαριστώ" is a common and polite way to express gratitude in Greek. It is often used in everyday conversations, as well as in more formal situations.
