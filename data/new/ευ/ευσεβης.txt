Word: ευσεβης

Etymology:
The word ευσεβης comes from the Greek word εὐσεβής (eusebēs), which is derived from the prefix εὖ (eu), meaning "good" or "well," and the word σέβομαι (sebomai), meaning "to revere" or "to worship." Therefore, ευσεβης can be translated as "pious," "devout," or "god-fearing."
