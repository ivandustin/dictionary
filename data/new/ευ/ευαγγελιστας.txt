Word: ευαγγελιστας

Etymology: The word ευαγγελιστας (evangelistas) comes from the Greek word ευαγγελίζω (evangelizo), which means "to announce good news" or "to proclaim the gospel." The suffix -της (-tas) is added to the verb to form the noun ευαγγελιστας, which means "one who proclaims the gospel" or "an evangelist."

Grammar: ευαγγελιστας is a masculine noun in the Greek language. It is in the nominative case, which is used for the subject of a sentence. The word can also be declined in other cases, such as the genitive, dative, and accusative, depending on its function in a sentence.

Description: ευαγγελιστας is a term used in Christianity to refer to someone who spreads the gospel or good news of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, the term is used to describe the four authors of the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These four evangelists are considered to be the primary sources of information about the life and teachings of Jesus. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to anyone who shares the message of Christianity with others.
