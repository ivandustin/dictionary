The word "ευαγγελισθεν" (evangelisthen) is a Greek verb that means "to be evangelized" or "to be preached the gospel." It is derived from the Greek words "ευαγγέλιον" (evangelion), meaning "good news" or "gospel," and "ισθμι" (isthmi), meaning "to stand." In grammar, it is a passive aorist participle, indicating that the action of being evangelized has already taken place in the past.
