Word: ευγενης

Etymology:
The word ευγενης (eugenēs) comes from the Greek roots ευ- (eu-), meaning "good" or "well," and γενος (genos), meaning "race" or "kind." Therefore, ευγενης originally meant "of good race" or "of noble birth."

Grammar:
In Greek, ευγενης is an adjective that agrees in gender, number, and case with the noun it modifies. For example, if it modifies a masculine singular noun in the nominative case, it would be ευγενης. If it modifies a feminine singular noun in the accusative case, it would be ευγενη.

Description:
The word ευγενης is used to describe someone who is of noble birth or has good breeding. It can also be used more broadly to describe someone who is well-mannered, courteous, or refined. In modern Greek, it is often used to describe someone who is polite or well-behaved.
