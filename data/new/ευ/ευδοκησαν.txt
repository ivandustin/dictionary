Etymology:
The word ευδοκησαν is a Greek verb that comes from the root words ευ (eu) meaning "good" and δοκεω (dokeo) meaning "to seem" or "to think". The verb form ευδοκεω (eudokeo) means "to be well-pleased" or "to approve", and the past tense form ευδοκησαν (eudokesan) means "they were well-pleased" or "they approved".

Description:
ευδοκησαν is a verb that expresses approval or satisfaction with something. It is often used in a religious or spiritual context to describe God's approval or pleasure with a person or action.

In modern Greek, the word is also used in a more general sense to express approval or satisfaction with something.
