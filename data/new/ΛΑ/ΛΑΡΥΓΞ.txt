Description: The larynx is a part of the respiratory system located in the throat. It is commonly referred to as the voice box as it plays a crucial role in producing sound and speech. The larynx contains the vocal cords, which vibrate when air passes through, producing sound. It also helps in protecting the airway during swallowing by closing off the entrance to the trachea.
