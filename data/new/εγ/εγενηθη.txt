Word: εγενηθη

Etymology:
The word εγενηθη (egenethē) is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γίνομαι (ginomai), which means "to become" or "to be born." The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the word to indicate a past tense form, making εγενηθη (egenethē) mean "was born" or "became."

Grammar:
εγενηθη (egenethē) is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb (in this case, the person who was born or became something) is the recipient of the action rather than the doer. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
εγενηθη (egenethē) is a verb that is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the birth or coming into existence of someone or something. For example, in the Gospel of John, the verb is used to describe the birth of Jesus: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:1, 14). The verb can also be used more generally to describe the coming into existence of anything, such as in the sentence "The universe was created and εγενηθη (egenethē) life on Earth."
