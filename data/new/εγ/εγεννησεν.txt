Word: εγεννησεν

Etymology: The word εγεννησεν comes from the Greek verb γεννάω (gennáo), which means "to beget" or "to give birth". The prefix ε- (e-) is a common Greek prefix that can indicate "out of" or "from", so εγεννησεν can be translated as "he/she/it begot" or "he/she/it gave birth to".

Grammar: εγεννησεν is a third person singular aorist active indicative form of the verb γεννάω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, without any reference to its duration or repetition. The active voice indicates that the subject of the verb is performing the action, and the indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description: εγεννησεν is a word that appears frequently in the New Testament of the Bible, where it is often used to describe the act of giving birth or begetting a child. For example, in Matthew 1:16, it is used to describe the birth of Jesus: "And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ." The word can also be used more generally to describe the act of bringing something into existence or giving rise to something.
