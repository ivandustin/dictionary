The word "εγερθεντι" is a Greek verb in the aorist tense, which means "to rise" or "to be raised." It is derived from the root word "εγείρω" (egero), which means "to wake up" or "to rouse." In terms of grammar, it is a third-person singular form of the verb, which means it refers to a single subject who is either rising or being raised.
