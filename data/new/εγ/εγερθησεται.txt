Word: εγερθησεται

Etymology:
The word εγερθησεται is a Greek verb that comes from the root word εγείρω (egero), which means "to raise up" or "to awaken". The verb is in the future tense and passive voice, which means that the subject will be raised up or awakened by someone or something else.

Grammar:
εγερθησεται is a third-person singular future passive indicative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the future tense suffix -σεται to the stem εγείρω (egero). The passive voice indicates that the subject will receive the action of the verb, rather than performing the action themselves.

Description:
The word εγερθησεται is used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is translated into English as "he will rise" or "he will be raised". The word emphasizes the idea that Jesus did not raise himself from the dead, but was raised by God the Father. The word can also be used more generally to describe someone or something being raised up or awakened from a state of sleep or death.
