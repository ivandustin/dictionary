Word: εγνωσθη

Etymology:
The word εγνωσθη is a Greek verb that comes from the root word γινώσκω (ginósko), which means "to know" or "to understand". The prefix ε- (e-) indicates a passive voice, meaning that the action is done to the subject of the sentence rather than the subject doing the action.

Grammar:
εγνωσθη is a third-person singular aorist passive indicative verb in Greek. The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject received the action rather than performing it. The indicative mood indicates that the verb is a statement of fact.

Description:
εγνωσθη can be translated to English as "was known" or "was recognized". It is often used in the New Testament of the Bible to describe how Jesus was recognized as the Son of God. For example, in John 1:31, it says "I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel." Then in verse 33, it says "I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God." Here, εγνωσθη is used to describe how John the Baptist recognized Jesus as the Son of God.
