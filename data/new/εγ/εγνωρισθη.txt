Word: εγνωρισθη

Etymology:
The word εγνωρισθη comes from the Greek verb γνωρίζω (gnorizo), which means "to make known" or "to inform". The prefix ε- (e-) is added to the beginning of the verb to indicate that the action is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action rather than performing it.

Grammar:
εγνωρισθη is a third person singular aorist passive indicative form of the verb γνωρίζω. In Greek, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a single event, rather than a continuous or ongoing action. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action of the verb, rather than performing it. In this case, εγνωρισθη means "he/she/it was made known" or "he/she/it was informed".

Description:
