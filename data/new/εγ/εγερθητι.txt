The word "εγερθητι" is a Greek verb in the aorist passive imperative form. Its root is "εγείρω" which means "to raise up" or "to awaken". The aorist tense indicates a completed action in the past, while the passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests.

Therefore, "εγερθητι" can be translated as "be raised up" or "be awakened" in English. It is often used in religious contexts, such as in the Bible, where it is used to describe the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
