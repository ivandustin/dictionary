Word: εγεννηθη

Etymology: εγεννηθη is a Greek word that comes from the verb γεννάω (gennao), which means "to beget" or "to give birth". The prefix ε- (e-) in εγεννηθη indicates the past tense, so the word means "was born" or "was begotten".

Grammar: εγεννηθη is a third person singular past tense form of the verb γεννάω (gennao). It is in the passive voice, indicating that the subject (the person who was born) received the action of the verb rather than performing it. In Greek, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, mood, and person/number of the subject.

Description: εγεννηθη is a word that describes the act of being born or begotten. It is often used in religious contexts to refer to the birth of Jesus Christ, as it appears in the New Testament of the Bible. The word can also be used more generally to describe the birth of any person or animal.
