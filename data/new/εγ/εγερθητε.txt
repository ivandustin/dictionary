Etymology:
The word εγερθητε comes from the Greek verb εγείρω (egeiró), which means "to wake up" or "to rise". It is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁wegʰ-, which means "to be strong" or "to wake up".

Grammar:
εγερθητε is a second person plural aorist passive imperative verb in Greek. It is formed by adding the passive aorist ending -ητε (-ete) to the stem εγερθ-, which is the aorist passive stem of the verb εγείρω (egeiró). The imperative mood is used to give commands or make requests, and the passive voice indicates that the subject is being acted upon.
