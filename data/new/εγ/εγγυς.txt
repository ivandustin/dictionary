Word: εγγυς

Etymology:
The word εγγυς (engus) comes from the Greek root word εν (en) meaning "in" or "within" and the Greek word γυιος (gyios) meaning "near" or "close". Together, they form the word εγγυς which means "nearby" or "close at hand".

In Greek, εγγυς is an adjective that can be used to describe a noun. It has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and three cases (nominative, genitive, and accusative). For example, in the sentence "Ο πατέρας είναι εγγύς" (O pateras einai engus), which means "The father is nearby", εγγύς is in the nominative masculine singular form.
