The word "ηπειθησαν" is a Greek verb that means "they disobeyed" in English. Here is the breakdown of the requested information:

Etymology: The word "ηπειθησαν" comes from the Greek root "πειθ-" which means "to persuade" or "to convince." The prefix "α-" negates the meaning, so "α-πειθ-" means "to not persuade" or "to not convince." The suffix "-ησαν" indicates the past tense, so "α-πειθ-ησαν" means "they did not persuade" or "they did not convince."

Grammar: "ηπειθησαν" is the third person plural form of the verb "απειθώ" (apeitho), which means "to disobey." In Greek grammar, verbs change their form based on the subject, tense, and mood. In this case, "ηπειθησαν" indicates that the subject is in the third person (they) and the action happened in the past.

Description: "ηπειθησαν" describes an action of disobedience or refusal to follow orders or instructions. It implies that the subject did not comply with what was expected or required of them.
