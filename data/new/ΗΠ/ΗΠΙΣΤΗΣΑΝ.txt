The word "ηπιστησαν" is a Greek verb in the past tense, third person plural form. It comes from the root verb "πιστεύω" (pistevo), which means "to believe" or "to trust". The prefix "ε-" (e-) indicates the past tense, and the suffix "-αν" (-an) indicates the third person plural form. Therefore, "ηπιστησαν" translates to "they believed" or "they trusted" in English.
