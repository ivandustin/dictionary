Description: "Τριστεγου" refers to a type of traditional Greek house with three roofs. These houses are typically found in the mountainous regions of Greece, particularly in the Peloponnese. The three roofs are designed to protect the house from the heavy snowfall in the winter. The architecture of tristegou houses is characterized by their stone walls, wooden roofs, and small windows. They are often built in a way that allows for multiple levels, with the upper floors used for living quarters and the ground floor used for storage or livestock.
