μαρτυρηθεντες (marturēthentes) is a Greek word that is the aorist passive participle of the verb μαρτυρέω (martureō), which means "to bear witness" or "to testify." The word is derived from the noun μάρτυς (martys), which means "witness." In Greek grammar, the aorist tense is used to describe a past action that is viewed as a whole, without specifying its duration or repetition. The passive voice indicates that the subject of the verb is being acted upon. Therefore, μαρτυρηθεντες can be translated as "having been testified" or "having been witnessed."
